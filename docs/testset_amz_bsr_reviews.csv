B0D7M9BKQY	Solid piece	坚固的碎片	"I have been using the desk for about 3 weeks.  It seems to be well made.  The drawers work smooth and sides and top are solid.  The black counter is a little tricky to keep looking nice.  Shows finger prints and smudges but not a big concern for me.  The only downside so far has been trying to find a keyboard tray that works.  The metal bar under the top, that keeps the two pieces secure, prohibits the installation of a tray.  Will continue to look for options.
I would recommend."	"我已经使用桌子大约3周了。它似乎做得很好。抽屉工作平稳，侧面和顶部是坚固的。黑色柜台看起来有些棘手。显示指纹和污迹，但对我来说不是一个大问题。到目前为止，唯一的缺点是试图找到有效的键盘托盘。顶部下方的金属棒可确保这两块固定，禁止安装托盘。将继续寻找选项。

B0D7M9BKQY	A solid purchase, but a few flaws	稳定的购买，但有一些缺陷	"I just purchased and assembled this desk to replace a worn-out desk of similar quality. Here's some notes for those who are considering the same:

* Shipping was fast. The desk shipped within 24 hours from CA. Since I'm in AZ it arrived only a few days later. The desk was packed in 2 boxes, which arrived one day apart. Not surprisingly the boxes are big and heavy, about 65lb and 85lb each. You'll definitely need a dolly or a couple strong people to help move them from your doorstep. The boxes themselves were damaged in transit, but the liberal use of styrofoam (yuck) prevented any damage inside.
* The instructions consisted of diagrams with minimal words. However the steps were mostly understandable and words were used to point out especially critical steps when the diagram wasn't clear enough.  Some steps were still vague however, requiring extra scrutiny or trial-and-error. All parts were clearly labeled and several spares of each screw and nut were generously included.
* The 45-steps took several hours to complete as not a single piece was pre-assembled. Having a helper insert dowels, screws or assemble drawers while you work on the major steps will save a lot of time. Also an electric screwdriver with a phillips and hex head will save a LOT of effort! Thankfully no other tools are required.
* Be sure to assemble the desk in the same room where it will be placed. The 2 sides are not designed to separate, and once assembled it is semi-permanent. Also be aware the cabinet on the left and the drawers on the right are NOT reversible, the pre-drilled holes do not allow for any option besides what is shown.
* For some inexplicable reason, several locknuts and screws are located on the outside of the desk so they are clearly visible. They could have easily been placed on the other side which would have hidden them under the desktop, but the manufacturer must assume this desk will be placed in a corner with both outer sides against the wall. At least small matching stickers are included to hide the some (but not all) of the holes, but it still looks unattractive if any outer side is visible to the room.
* For pre-fab, engineered wood furniture this desk is pretty sturdy. The wood plates are thick and heavy, and the joined pieces are highly reinforced. For example there over 28 locknuts and screws securing the desktop to the body.  The drawers are solid and slide easily and appear they could hold a lot of weight.
* The cabinet does not have any holes or perforations on the back panel. If you plan on placing a PC or other electric equipment inside, you'll have to cut a wiring hole yourself.
* The black surface of the desk looks nice, especially compared to the faux-woodgrain design of other cheap furniture, but it seems every speck of dust and fingerprint is obvious. It's likely the surface will never look pristine!

Overall I'm happy with my purchase. There are some flaws and room for improvement, but I feel like I got my money worth. This isn't something you'll pass on to your grandkids, but its certainly good enough to write this review on!"	"我刚刚购买并组装了这张桌子，以更换质量相似的破旧桌子。对于那些考虑相同的人来说，这是一些注释：

 *运输很快。桌子在24小时内运送了。由于我在亚利桑那州，只有几天后才到达。桌子被包装在两个盒子里，这些盒子相隔一天。毫不奇怪，这些盒子又大又重，每个盒子大约65磅和85磅。您肯定需要一个多莉或几个强大的人来帮助他们从您的家门口移动。盒子本身在运输中受到了损坏，但自由使用泡沫聚苯乙烯（yuck）阻止了内部的任何损坏。
 *指令由图表组成，其中词最少。但是，这些步骤几乎是可以理解的，并且在图表不够清楚时，用词指出了特别的关键步骤。但是，一些步骤仍然模糊，需要进行额外的审查或试用。所有零件都清楚地标记了，每个螺丝和螺母的几个备件都大量包括在内。
 * 45步需要几个小时才能完成，因为没有一件作品是预组装的。在主要步骤上工作时，请使用辅助插件，螺丝或组装抽屉，可以节省大量时间。另外，还有带有菲利普斯和六角头的电动螺丝刀可以节省大量精力！值得庆幸的是，无需其他工具。
 *确保在将放置的同一房间组装桌子。这两个侧的设计不是为分开的，并且一旦组装成半永久性。另外，请注意左侧的机柜和右侧的抽屉是不可逆的，除了显示的内容外，预钻孔的孔不允许任何选择。
 *出于某些无法解释的原因，几个防松螺母和螺钉位于桌子外部，因此清晰可见。它们可以很容易地放在另一侧，这可以将它们隐藏在台式机下，但是制造商必须假设该桌子将放在一个角落，两侧都靠在墙壁上。至少包括小匹配贴纸来隐藏一些（但不是全部）孔，但是如果房间可见任何外侧，它仍然没有吸引力。
 *对于预装，工程木制家具，此桌子非常坚固。木板厚又重，并且连接的碎片高度加固。例如，有28多个防松螺母和螺钉将桌面固定到身体。抽屉很固体，很容易滑动，看起来它们可以承受很多重量。
 *机柜在后面板上没有任何孔或穿孔。如果您打算将PC或其他电动设备放入其中，则必须自己切一个接线孔。
 *桌子的黑色表面看起来不错，尤其是与其他廉价家具的人造木质设计相比，但似乎每个灰尘和指纹的斑点都是显而易见的。表面可能永远不会看起来很原始！

总的来说，我对我的购买感到满意。有一些缺陷和改进的空间，但我觉得自己的钱值得。这不是您将其传递给孙子孙女的东西，但它肯定足以写这篇评论！"	Y		Color: White	4	4					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RR4XJEH328EYT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7M9BKQY	A.

B0D7M9BKQY	Great Purchase! Solid Desk.	很棒的购买！坚固的桌子。	"I absolutely love my new desk. There is room for everything. I upgraded to a corner desk because my new project requires that I use their company laptop, and I still needed to use my company’s laptop. With this desk the layout is perfect.
It took my husband several hours to assemble. He did it a little bit at a time after work for a few nights, so I can’t give an exact time, but it was from 4-6 hours. He’s very good with building and woodworking. He did tell me that someone less skilled at such things would be able to assemble it. The directions were clear.
I have two negatives.
1. One of the corners had about a quarter size chip. I am not bothered by it, but some others may be.
2. The edges are rough. If the edges were beveled, it would be so much better. I’ll need to find a solution as it is irritating to my forearms as I type. I’m sure that I’ll find a solution. They are beveled on the bottom, so it is possible that the manufactured put the drill and bit holes on the wrong side of the boards.
This is a sturdy desk that should last me for many years. It is a huge win for me!"	"我绝对喜欢我的新桌子。一切都有空间。我升级到了转角台，因为我的新项目要求我使用他们的公司笔记本电脑，而且我仍然需要使用公司的笔记本电脑。使用此桌子，布局是完美的。
我丈夫花了几个小时组装。他在下班后一次做了几个晚上做了一点，所以我不能给确切的时间，但这是从4-6个小时开始。他非常擅长建造和木工。他确实告诉我，一个不太熟练的人将能够组装出来。指示很明显。
我有两个负面因素。
 1。其中一个角有大约四分之一尺寸的芯片。我不被它打扰，但其他有些可能是。
 2。边缘很粗糙。如果边缘是斜面的，那就更好了。我需要找到一个解决方案，因为它在输入时会对我的前臂感到刺激。我确定我会找到解决方案。它们的斜面位于底部，因此制造的钻头和位孔可能在木板的错误侧。
这是一张坚固的桌子，应该持续很多年。对我来说，这是一个巨大的胜利！"	Y		Color: White	4	5	1.0	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Tg-fg+6JL._SY200.jpg			https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29SZUDW7213P8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7M9BKQY	Cindy Willis	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFV4HOXTDB2IKION57XDXIWFYTHQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2024-12-26

B0D7M9BKQY	Nice desk for the money	不错的钱	It's going to take a few hours to assemble so set aside a half day to do this.  It's like putting a 500 piece puzzle together, lol.  It was not difficult, but took longer than expected. You really have to pay attention to the pictures and look ahead a few steps to understand at times, but it came out better than expected.  The top of the desk is very easily damaged so be careful when dealing with those 2 parts especially.  Great desk for the money.  Fit very well in a small corner space in my bonus room.	组装需要花费几个小时，所以请搁置半天的时间。这就像将500件拼图放在一起，大声笑。这并不困难，但花费的时间比预期的要长。您确实必须关注图片，并有时要了解一些步骤，但它比预期的要好。桌子的顶部很容易损坏，因此特别是在处理这两个部分时要小心。很棒的桌子。在我的奖金室的一个小角落空间中非常适合。	Y		Color: White	5	9	1.0	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mmyOOye7L._SY200.jpg			https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFMFBWQ377X2C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7M9BKQY	kbcatc	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHHX5ISGN6IOZVA57FZ4B7IKVSOA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2024-10-21

B0D7MLN7DT	Great Desk	很棒的桌子	I bought this for my home office.  The unit is quite solid, attractive and functional.  The only issue I would impart is that you need to set aside some time to assemble this unit.  The instructions were good, but lengthy and time is needed to do the job and do it right.  But that's pretty much inevitable with a product such as this isn't it?  That said, the desk was well packaged and arrived in good condition.  ALL of the drilled holes for the hardware lined-up perfectly.

DO NOT USE A Drill/Screw gun to put this together as its rather cheaper material but still very sturdy once assembled.
Only issue i would say is they could send it with a longer/better screw driver."	"在阅读了所有有关组装和到达损坏有多困难的评论之后，我担心的是，但幸运的是，一切都没有损坏。
大会花了我大约3个小时，但是如果您曾经把桌子放在一起，然后再简直，说明就可以了。一些评论说，这些指示不清楚，但对我来说是。
请勿使用钻/螺旋枪将其作为更便宜的材料将其放在一起，但一旦组装而仍然非常坚固。
我要说的唯一问题是他们可以使用更长/更好的螺丝刀发送它。"	Y		Color: Rustic Brown	4	0					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36NG0TSZS5G8I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CS9KGS3J	Joshua Carter	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFD7RKJLALWOV7PVZYH65ZRN3NKQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2024-12-31

B0CRK7RJ5M	Honestly love it	老实说	"I will say I have decent know how and can be crafty. While the directions are not perfect and sometimes its good to look ahead a few steps to double check how it matches up later. It does in fact all fit together correctly. In my case at least.
For me it's perfect, the height and size of desk make it very spacious and comfortable. It's fairly sturdy so long as your good will your l wrenches. Though at a couple times I found it grueling, getting half rotations and reseting the wrench back to fully tighten it in the corner sockets.
My only issue of it all truly was how the directions made me feel unsure at times which way im suppoped to be looking at the piece im holding. And 2 different sets of pieces were miss numbered(just swapped them around in the build). Though I infact had all the pieces I needed.
Solo build in about 5 hours for both pieces. Arrived separate days so 2 separate build days combined. If you attempt this solo have something with adjustable height for balancing/leveling of bars and boards. It'll be handy."	"我会说我很体面知道如何和狡猾。虽然这些方向并不完美，有时可以向前看几个步骤以仔细检查以后的匹配方式。实际上，它确实正确地融合在一起。至少在我的情况下。
对我来说，这是完美的，桌子的高度和尺寸使其非常宽敞舒适。只要您的善意，它的努力就相当坚固。虽然几次我发现它很艰难，但要进行半轮旋转并重置扳手以将其完全拧紧在角落插座上。
我唯一的问题确实是指示如何使我有时不确定以哪种方式看着我所持有的作品。错过了两套不同的碎片（在构建中换成了它们）。尽管我实际上有我需要的所有作品。
独奏在大约5个小时内为两件作品建造。到达分开的天数，因此共有2个单独的构建天。如果您尝试此独奏，则具有可调节高度的某些东西，以平衡/平衡条形和板。这将是方便的。"	Y		Color: Grey	5	2	5.0	"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6119gpIKStL._SY200.jpg

Quality wise, this is still made out of particle board or something similar, but it is very dense and much more durable than the stuff you get buying the $100-$200 range desks. I was dragging this around, flipping it over, etc and it wasn't being damaged at all.

There's a ton of well utilized space and my computer tucks in really well in the bottom corner. I also love that it's really deep and I can put my monitor really far away.

The only thing I would say needs improvement are the instructions.

Assembling the desk was much easier than the cabinet.  Please make sure you’re patient.  When assembling the desk I’d recommend you not tighten the table top pieces until you’ve placed all 4 tops.

The table top is engineered so don’t over tightened the screws to the top.

Also once your desk is built do not try to lift it with the wood.  Make sure when you move the desk, lift with the metal base or the screw would strip off the wood. “See video”"	"全面的。很棒的桌子。我建议。

组装桌子比机柜容易得多。请确保您有耐心。组装桌子时，我建议您在放置所有4个上衣之前不要拧紧桌面碎片。 t这将使您可以将顶部对齐，均匀均匀。放置所有碎片后，然后拧紧螺钉。

桌面是经过设计的，因此不要将螺丝拧到顶部。

同样，一旦建造了桌子，就不会尝试用木头抬起它。确保在移动桌子时，用金属底座抬起，螺丝将剥离木头。 “看视频”"	Y		Color: White	4	9	5.0	"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-nSQDE-0L._SY200.jpg

	Nice design, still worth the price despite small fails	不错的设计，尽管失败很小，但仍然值得价格	Nice design, perfect for a remote work from home professional like me. All the other desks I looked at seemed like they were built for gamers or kids, so this was a nice find. I’m giving this one a 4 instead of a 5 because there were some quality control issues with some of the panels and the feet for the side cabinet were missing. They gave me a partial refund of $78 for the panels and sent me a set of feet for the cabinet so I’m a happy camper now. You may find that when attaching the top desk panels they may not all be perfectly flat, you can adjust the screws for that or add a few shims as needed. Some of the decorative metal is pretty thin and mine arrived bent up, but it can be bent back if needed. There were issues but not any game changers, and their customer service was exceptional: they responded immediately and took care of the issues stat. Would I buy a desk from this company again? Yes, absolutely. They care about their customers.	精美的设计，非常适合像我这样的家庭专业人士的远程工作。我看过的所有其他桌子似乎都是为游戏玩家或孩子们建造的，所以这是一个很好的发现。我给这个一个4而不是5，因为某些面板有一些质量控制问题，而侧柜的脚丢失了。他们给了我一部分的面板78美元的退款，并给我送了一组橱柜，所以我现在是一个快乐的露营者。您可能会发现，连接顶部台式面板时，它们可能并非都完全平坦，可以调整螺钉的螺钉或根据需要添加一些垫片。一些装饰性金属非常薄，我的到达弯曲，但是如果需要，它可以弯曲。有问题，但没有任何改变游戏规则的人，他们的客户服务非常出色：他们立即做出了回应并处理了问题统计数据。我会再次从这家公司买桌子吗？是的，绝对。他们关心客户。	Y			4	4					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XP1DI2AK6SPS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CS9KGS3J	vikingufo	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/b2324b34-0415-4ed6-a051-523ff963deed._CR0,0,400,400_SX48_.jpg	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEXPGILUAKPI46CRDEJJGBWVGIQA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2024-01-20

B0CRK7RJ5M	Very nice	很不错	"Searched for a desk to suit my needs for a while now, most are too narrow. This desk is 63"" x 31.5"", and the moveable side return is 39.5"" X 15.75"" - Perfect for my needs.

You can move the return anywhere you want it, even if you put the 2 pieces across the room it looks nice.

Assembly wasn't hard, but the bottom of the Cabinet/Return has holes marked where the screws for the feet should go, but the holes don't line up with the holes in the feet, I was able to overcome this issue with a slow cordless drill and there are supposed to be some plastic corner pieces that go in the back, but my particular box was missing those. Not enough to remove a star.

B0D1GDY42V	This desk is massive, very heavy, assembly can be tricky	这张桌子很大，很重，组装可能很棘手	"This desk is sleek, functional, and spacious enough to accommodate my setup, which includes two dual monitors (one 34” and the other 32”), my desktop PC, and two docking stations. Even with all of this, I still have room for other items, making it the ideal size for my needs. However, a desk of this size requires ample space for assembly and placement, as well as time and patience due to the complexity of the setup.

At 6’2” and 200 lbs, I’m in good shape, which came in handy because the desk arrives in two separate, very heavy boxes. The boxes are also quite long, making it difficult to move them from my driveway, up the stairs, and into my 10x8 office by myself. I managed, but it wasn’t easy.

Given my limited space, my assembly method was crucial. I carefully laid out all the pieces and hardware in chronological order, which saved me a lot of time searching for the right parts. Despite the challenges, I was able to assemble the desk in about two hours. However, handling the longer pieces and fitting them without damaging the composite board was particularly tricky.

My recommendation is to have someone help you lift the boxes and assist with the assembly. This would make the process much easier.

The reason I’m giving this desk 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the drawers. The alignment is difficult to get right on the first try, and I was especially concerned about stripping the screws. Even now, the drawers aren’t perfectly aligned, but they work. Additionally, I had to purchase new handles because the ones provided wouldn’t tighten properly, due to insufficient thread depth in the female portion of the handles. While the new handles I bought look much better, it was an extra $20 expense that I would have preferred to avoid, especially considering the desk cost $380.

Now that the assembly is complete, I’m happy with the desk, and it will likely never leave the room it’s in.

I’ll post some pictures when I’m done with the office."	"这张桌子时尚，实用且宽敞，足以容纳我的设置，其中包括两个双显示器（一个34英寸和另一个32英寸），我的台式PC和两个对接站。即使所有这些，我仍然还有其他物品的空间，使其成为满足我需求的理想尺寸。但是，由于设置的复杂性，这种尺寸的桌子需要足够的空间来进行组装和放置以及时间和耐心。

我的身材为6'2英寸和200磅，我的身体状况良好，因为桌子到达两个独立的，非常沉重的盒子，所以派上用场了。这些盒子也很长，因此很难从我的车道，上楼梯上移动到我的10x8办公室。我管理了，但这并不容易。

鉴于我有限的空间，我的装配方法至关重要。我按时间顺序仔细地布置了所有碎片和硬件，这为我节省了很多时间来寻找正确的部分。尽管面临挑战，但我还是可以在大约两个小时内组装桌子。但是，处理较长的零件并将其安装而不损坏复合板特别棘手。

我的建议是让某人帮助您举起盒子并协助组装。这将使过程变得更加容易。

我给这台桌子4星而不是5星的原因是因为抽屉。第一次尝试很难对齐，我特别担心剥离螺钉。即使是现在，抽屉也不完全排列，但它们起作用。此外，我不得不购买新的手柄，因为由于手柄的女性部分的螺纹深度不足，提供的手柄无法正确拧紧。虽然我购买的新手柄看起来好多了，但这是我宁愿避免的额外的20美元费用，尤其是考虑到桌子的价格为380美元。

现在，组件已经完成，我对桌子感到满意，它可能永远不会离开房间。

完成办公室后，我会发布一些图片。"	Y		Color: Walnut & Black	4	8					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22TGBI3F7VKPP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D1GDY42V	Adam P.	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/609ab8af-03d9-457d-bbec-80c8c16f3f92._CR0,0,374,374_SX48_.jpg	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFHUFQFYNRBH4H3FXCD2XUEN3X3A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2024-08-27

B0D6RCDZDZ	Sturdy, well built desk for home office	坚固，建造精良的家庭办公室	"This desk is amazing for the money. Incredibly sturdy desk, heavy hard wood top that can take a lot of abuse. Item was packaged extremely well which prevented any damage while in the box.

Assembly did take a long time (5-6 hours) and I'm a very handy builder and have worked construction most of my life, so be prepared to work when you get it.

The drawers and hinges are also very sturdy. Lots of storage space in this desk and everything lined up perfectly.

Overall this is a fantastic desk, very well built and will last a long time. Packaging was good and the only downside is how long it takes to assemble. Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a large and well built desk for their home office."	"这张桌子真是太棒了。令人难以置信的坚固桌子，厚实的硬木上衣，可能会遭受很多滥用。包装非常好，这阻止了盒子中的任何损坏。

大会确实花了很长时间（5-6个小时），我是一个非常方便的建筑商，一生中大部分时间都在工作，所以准备好时要工作。

抽屉和铰链也很坚固。这张桌子上有很多存储空间，一切都完美排列。

总体而言，这是一张很棒的桌子，建造得很好，可以持续很长时间。包装很好，唯一的缺点是组装需要多长时间。强烈推荐给任何为其家庭办公室寻找大型且建筑良好的办公桌的人。"	Y		Color: Antique White	5	0	3.0	"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619f8uXvPrL._SY200.jpg

B0D6RCDZDZ	Beautiful even after 7 Hour Construction	即使经过7小时的建设，美丽	"Received this desk within 2 days. The box was incredibly heavy and upon opening it, we immediately noticed that absolutely no parts were put together and absolutely none of the thousand screws, hex bolts, lock washers and dowels were inserted. Not even the drawer slides and handles were attached. The directions were very clear and stated to not use power tools, but I did carefully, otherwise it would have taken another day to put together. The construction time (which several reviews mention) is the only reason I didn’t give it five stars.

All that being said, the finished product is beautiful and solid. It looks like a piece that would cost several hundred dollars more. We could not be happier with the purchase and will enjoy this for many years to come."

	Pleasantly Surprised	惊喜	"At this price point I was expecting lesser quality. However, like the title suggests, I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality of this desk!

Pros: Beautiful wood grain and texture, feels durable, quality drawer hardware, lovely handles, detailed and accurate instructions, easy to assemble (but do suggest having assistance during certain steps - as the instructions also clearly indicate.)

Cons: While the instructions give clear guidance on how to adjust the door cabinet hardware to sit straight, and also how to adjust the drawer hardware to have square drawers, this is a tedious task. I managed to get my drawers and cabinet to sit straight enough to not drive me crazy, but if the company would pre-install these aspects to sit square (other furniture purchases were sent with pre-installed hardware) then it would be a 5/5. The hardware installation took the most time out of everything and is the single most effective aspect to having properly spaced drawers and cabinetry that are the entire face of this piece of furniture. Because of the amount of hardware to be installed PLUS the difficulty of adjusting the drawers (cabinet door not so bad, but drawers require going into assembled desk and finagling three tiny screws per hardware piece - one drawer has 4 hardware pieces), I'm giving it 4 stars. Secondly, and least importantly, a larger plug port (existing has two plugs, 1 C port and 1 USB port) would be much appreciated.

I would and do still absolutely recommend this desk."	"在这个价格点，我期望质量较低。但是，就像标题所暗示的那样，我对这张桌子的质量感到非常惊喜！

优点：美丽的木纹和质地，感觉耐用，高质量的抽屉硬件，可爱的手柄，详细和准确的说明，易于组装（但建议在某些步骤中提供帮助 - 正如说明也清楚地表明。

缺点：虽然说明提供了有关如何调整门柜硬件直接坐下的明确指导，以及如何调整抽屉硬件以配备方形抽屉，但这是一项繁琐的任务。我设法让我的抽屉和橱柜直接坐着足够直接使我发疯，但是如果公司预先安装这些方面以坐在广场上（其他家具的购买是用预装的硬件发送的），那将是5/ 5。硬件安装花费了最大的时间，这是最有效的方面，它是该家具的整个面孔适当间隔的抽屉和橱柜。由于要安装大量的硬件以及调整抽屉的难度（橱柜门还不错，但是抽屉需要进入组装的桌子，并为每个硬件件的三个小螺钉罚款 - 一个抽屉有4个硬件），我是我的，我给它4星。其次，至少重要的是，较大的插头端口（现有两个插头，1 C端口和1个USB端口）将不胜感激。

我会而且仍然绝对推荐这张桌子。"	Y			4	1	5.0	"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71QPkUaABvL._SY200.jpg

B0D6RCDZDZ	Seller communication not perfect but ultimately took care of probe,	卖方交流不完美，但最终照顾了调查，	Desk arrived ahead of schedule. It’s a very heavy package, so I opened box and carried the components up two flights of stairs, making about 10-12 trips. The desk top was at the bottom of the package and was the last piece out of the box. When I flipped it over to inspect, I saw that it had a half-inch deep crack running the entire width of the desk. It was unusable. I reported the broken desk top and asked for a replacement. The next morning, I had a message from the seller asking for photos but providing no information about what they were going to do about the issue. I sent the photos and also told the seller that I discovered I was missing one of the boards (#9) needed for assembly. I asked if they could send the board along with a new top. Then I waited for three or four days before I got an answer. I thought they should have responded in a more timely manner, fwiw. Anyhow, they shipped me an entirely new desk. I took the top out (it was not damaged and looked great) and the #9 board out and began assembling. Assembly was not difficult, but it took me 6.5 hours working alone on the project. Everything fit together well. Had no problems with alignment, and the desk, I think, looks really good and should serve my needs. Now I need to figure out to do with the remainder of the second desk that was sent me.	桌子提前到达。这是一个非常沉重的包装，所以我打开了盒子，将零件带上了两个楼梯，进行了约10-12次旅行。桌面的顶部位于包装的底部，是盒子里的最后一件。当我将其翻转以进行检查时，我看到它在整个桌子的整个宽度上都有半英寸的深裂缝。这是无法使用的。我报告了破损的桌面，并要求替换。第二天早上，我收到了卖方的消息，要求提供照片，但没有提供有关他们将要做什么的信息。我发送了照片，还告诉卖方，我发现我缺少一个组装所需的董事会之一（＃9）。我问他们是否可以将董事会与新上衣一起发送。然后我等了三到四天才得到答案。我以为他们应该及时回应，FWIW。无论如何，他们把我的一张全新的桌子运送了。我拿出顶部（它没有损坏，看上去很棒），＃9板出去并开始组装。大会并不困难，但是我花了6.5个小时独自在该项目上工作。一切都很好。对齐没有问题，我认为桌子看起来真的很好，应该满足我的需求。现在，我需要弄清楚与发送给我的第二个桌子的其余部分有关。	Y		Color: Antique White	4	0					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FNFQW2QMR0LV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6RCDZDZ	Jeff	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AESFO2PMVKEKMPSCDU45O5SYUQSA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2025-01-24

B0D6RCDZDZ	Came broken, hard to put together	破碎了，很难放在一起	The two back panels came with broken sections but since the desk/packaging is so heavy and the panels were in the back, it wasn't worth trying to get it returned. It does look as advertised once it's put together (and looks pretty nice!) but be prepared for hours of drilling and screwing. Also, the preset holes on a couple of the drawers weren't aligned properly so had to mark, measure, and drill new holes (specifically on the middle drawer the keyboard goes in). If this is the desk with the exact look you want then get it and have realistic expectations for putting it together.	两个后面板带有破损的部分，但是由于桌子/包装非常重，并且面板在后面，因此不值得尝试将其返回。一旦整理在一起，它的确像广告宣传（看起来还不错！），但要准备好几个小时的钻孔和拧紧。另外，几个抽屉上的预设孔不正确对齐，因此必须标记，测量和钻新的孔（尤其是在键盘中的中间抽屉上）。如果这是您想要的确切外观的桌子，请获得它，并具有将其放在一起的现实期望。	Y		Color: Antique White	3	0					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIDKWUK35FIEK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6RCDZDZ	Amazon Customer	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHBMHIQRFJTNZQTQ2AYXMYPEDCQQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2024-10-25

Once it is together it does feel very solid and sturdy. I love the amount of storage space. The desk top did come damaged and I have reached out to get a replacement. I am also having trouble with the file cabinet drawer. The drawer won’t close and if forced it pops off the tracks. The silver metal slider on one side keeps getting stuck in the back. I’ve also requested replacement for this. I will update my review depending on the results from customer service.

Update:  I contacted the seller and they sent me a whole new desk instead of replacement pieces. They were very helpful and fixed the issue quickly."	"这张桌子总体上很漂亮。桌子很重，花了很长时间才整理在一起，但我不介意。一旦在一起，它确实会感到非常坚固和坚固。我喜欢存储空间的数量。办公桌上的上衣确实受到了损坏，我已经伸出手来替换。我在文件柜抽屉方面也遇到了麻烦。抽屉不会关闭，如果强迫将其弹出。一侧的银色金属滑块不断被卡在后面。我还要求替换。我将根据客户服务的结果来更新我的评论。

	Absolutely beautiful, everyone asks where I got it	绝对美丽，每个人都问我从哪里得到它	"This desk is absolutely perfect, exactly what I wanted! The box was extremely heavy when it arrived. Luckily my son was home from college for the weekend and was able to help me carry it inside. It is really heavy!

I am so lucky to have a mechanically-inclined friend who was able to help me with the assembly. First we separated the parts into piles that went together. This was really helpful while assembling but also to make sure we had everything.

It took several hours, on about 3 days. I ended up finishing the drawers by myself. But my friend had to stop by and help me adjust the center drawer-it was off and had to be adjusted by moving the sliding brackets down a bit. I wasn't sure what to do so he helped.

I wanted this desk in the middle of the room, facing the door. I live alone now and didn't want my back to the hallway/door. This desk is not shown from the back in the listing, so I included a picture so you could see mine.

Overall, I'm so pleased with this desk. The two friends that stopped by were really impressed and wanted the link so they could check it out themselves. Be sure to have a plan for assembly, and allow plenty of time."	"这张桌子绝对是完美的，正是我想要的！盒子到达时非常沉重。幸运的是，我的儿子周末在大学里回家，能够帮助我把它带进去。真的很重！

我很幸运能有一个机械划分的朋友，他能够帮助我参加大会。首先，我们将零件分成堆在一起。组装时确实很有帮助，也可以确保我们拥有一切。

大约3天花了几个小时。我最终自己完成了抽屉。但是我的朋友不得不停下来并帮助我调整中心抽屉 - 它已经关闭了，必须通过将滑动支架向下移动一点来调整。我不确定该怎么做，他提供了帮助。

我想在房间中间，面对门。我现在一个人住，不想回到走廊/门。该桌子没有从列表中的背面显示，因此我包含了一张图片，以便您可以看到我的图片。

总的来说，我对这张桌子感到非常满意。停下来的两个朋友确实给人留下了深刻的印象，并想要链接，以便他们自己检查一下。请确保有一个计划的计划，并有足够的时间。"	Y			5	12	2.0	"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/816mx3TY0GL._SY200.jpg

	Difficult to assemble without the right tools	如果没有正确的工具，难以组装	"I purchased this desk primarily because reviews have praised its ease of assembly, but this desk took me a week of afterwork hours to assemble. You will definitely require a good Philips-head screwdriver; I also purchased a multi-bit screwdriver shaped like a Z for extra leverage because some of those screws do not go in easily. Assembly is doable alone, but would be much faster and easier with an extra hand.
Also, one of the pieces was cracked on arrival.
Now that it's assembled, it's an awesome looking desk with great functionality, especially for the price. It was really just the process of assembling it that soured the experience."	"我之所以购买此桌子主要是因为评论赞扬了它的容易设备，但是这张桌子花了我一个星期的工作时间来组装。您肯定需要一个好的飞利浦头螺丝刀；我还购买了形状像Z的多重螺丝刀，以备额外的杠杆作用，因为其中一些螺钉不容易插入。组装单独是可行的，但额外的手会更快，更容易。
另外，其中一块在到达时被破裂。
现在已经组装了，它是一张很棒的桌子，具有出色的功能，尤其是价格。实际上，组装它的过程使经历酸痛。"	Y			3	0					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RAGYO3A7DB6K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6RCDZDZ	NewUser	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFVWOLGCBL3WRNMFYOLQOEZR6AFQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2024-09-21

B0D6RCDZDZ	Nice Desk	漂亮的桌子	This desk had great step by step instructions for assembling. It took several hours to put it together but turned out very nice.

B0D6RCDZDZ	Fabulous desk!	神话般的桌子！	"First,  I would like to thank the seller for the great price.  I was looking in furniture stores for a very similar desk and the furniture stores wanted between $1500 & $2000.  I am extremely pleased with the quality and actually put this desk in my sitting room as it matches my decor.
Second, assembly was fairly easy with the parts all labeled & pieces separated into baggies.  The only tools I needed were a magnetic Phillips head screwdriver and the included Allen wrench.  Overall, it took about 4 hours to assemble but was totally worth the savings.  Also, although my delivery was a little roughed-up, the contents inside the box was not damaged as it was very well packed.  The box was about 150 lbs and requires 2 people to lift.  Some of the assembly steps require 2 people as it is heavy.  With that said, the quality of the desk top is beautiful,solid wood.  Great quality and a great price.  It was SO worth the time putting it together."	"首先，我要感谢卖方的价格。我在家具店里寻找一张非常相似的桌子，而家具店想要$ 1500至2000美元。我对质量感到非常满意，实际上将这张桌子放在我的客厅里，因为它与我的装饰匹配。
其次，组装非常容易，所有零件都标有零件，并将其分成袋子。我唯一需要的工具是磁性菲利普斯头螺丝刀和随附的艾伦扳手。总体而言，组装大约花了大约4个小时，但完全值得节省。另外，尽管我的交货有些粗糙，但盒子内的内容没有损坏，因为它装满了。该盒子约为150磅，需要2个人抬起。一些组装步骤需要2个人，因为它很重。话虽如此，桌面的质量是美丽的实木。高质量，价格优惠。值得花时间将其放在一起。"	Y		Color: Antique White	5	32	1.0	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LEFd0TblL._SY200.jpg			https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RL22QXHLFFAZM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D6RCDZDZ	April M.

I agree with other reviews that the set up takes forever and there are SO MANY PARTS! I am petite/5’3 and bought a computer chair that is equivalent to the height of a dining room table chair, nothing special and I have a hard time putting my legs under so I do wish it was taller. Also, the drawers aren’t as deep as the desk is so that’s a bummer they are so small. It’s just big enough to fit a 8 x 10 sheet of paper.  Overall looks beautiful but functionality can be improved.	桌子看起来很漂亮，尽管有点欺骗。 Kinda希望我订购了另一种。我同意其他评论，即设置需要永远，并且有很多部分！我身材娇小/5'3，买了一张相当于餐桌椅高度的计算机椅，没什么特别的，我很难将我的腿放在下面，所以我希望它更高。另外，抽屉不像桌子那样深，所以这是一个很小的东西。它足够大，可以安装8 x 10张纸。总体看起来很漂亮，但功能可以改善。	Y		"Size: 30""H | Color: Off White"	3	0	2.0	"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OSaBmrPfL._SY200.jpg

B0DDTNJKNN	File drawer is 11-1/2 by 10	文件抽屉是11-1/2乘10	The desk is solid and fairly straightforward.  Good storage space  and true to color depicted on Amazon.  Just one issue but for us it is pretty significant:  The drawers are not very deep/long.  They measure just 11-1/2” in length and 10” wide. The file drawer (lower right) is mainly where this is a problem for us.  A typical file folder system has to be compacted to fit and forget about a hanging file set up.  Not sure why they made the drawers so shallow — if they were the depth of the desk itself, it would have much better functionality.  The cabinet (lower left) is the full depth of the desk itself — — 20”.  Read the drawer sizes carefully — depending on your needs, it may or may not work for you.  Otherwise the desk is very solid.	桌子很扎实，相当简单。良好的存储空间，呈现为亚马逊上描绘的颜色。只是一个问题，但对我们来说这很重要：抽屉不是很深/很长。它们的长度仅为11-1/2英寸，宽10英寸。文件抽屉（右下）主要是对我们来说是一个问题。必须压实典型的文件文件夹系统，以适合并忘记设置的悬挂文件。不确定为什么他们使抽屉如此浅 - 如果它们是桌子本身的深度，它将具有更好的功能。机柜（左下）是桌子本身的完整深度 -   -  20英寸。仔细阅读抽屉尺寸 - 根据您的需求，它可能对您有效，也可能不起作用。否则桌子非常扎实。	Y		"Size: 30""H | Color: Weatherworn Grey"	4	0					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8OUJIX9UCIH6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQM7RH4X	tallhallgoofball	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AED5IPOS6S3DVLRADHGJIJSRADAA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2025-02-06

B0CQM7RH4X	Pretty desk, lots of time to assembly	漂亮的桌子，很多时间组装	It's a beautiful desk and very heavy! It ended up taking myself over 5 hours to assemble, along with the 5 drawers.  Not enough wood glue, but I had some myself, buy some for sure to use for all the dowels. Take your time and add the glue at all dowels and have a wet rag hang to wipe any squeeze out.  Be careful not to over torque screws,  some very small and kinda cheap, but whatever. Again,  nice desk, saved money assembling myself, but be prepared to follow the image instruction guide and take hours to complete. Not sure I would buy it again unassembled, vs a furniture store and pay for assembled desk. One drawer a bit tight, but made it work.	这是一张漂亮的桌子，非常沉重！最终花了5个小时的时间与5个抽屉一起组装。没有足够的木质胶水，但是我有一些自己，一定要购买一些销钉。花点时间，在所有销钉中加入胶水，并悬挂湿的抹布以擦拭任何挤压。请注意不要过度扭矩螺钉，有些很小，有点便宜，但是无论如何。再次，漂亮的桌子，节省了自己的钱，但请准备遵循图像指南并花费数小时完成。不确定我是否会再次购买它，而不是家具店，然后支付组装桌子。一个抽屉有点紧，但使其起作用。	Y		"Size: 30""H | Color: Off White"	4	4	4.0	"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714MpdyeEAL._SY200.jpg

B0CQM7RH4X	Beautiful desk with minor issues	美丽的桌子和小问题	This desk is aesthetically beautiful-it is off white with a black deck top. It is sturdy. It did take some time to put together because there were so many small little parts and tedious work. The problem we ran into is that we were missing five handles and all the screws that went with the handles. pretty frustrating. I contacted the seller and they initially responded that it would take 7 to 15 days for the parts to get ordered and sent out since it was out of stock or I could go purchase the parts and they would reimburse me $30. I advised them it would be more than $30. I would have to try to find matching handles which are not your traditional handles and all the screws that went with the handles. I requested to be refunded $50 because that is more appropriate on top of having to travel to different stores to find the parts that would match or a match closely. The seller obliged and refunded $50 to me. No arguments at all. The only thing I wish was that the seller communicated quickly but that is OK. pleased with the desk and the way it looks, and it’s great for studying. The seller was professional and rectified the situation with no arguments.	这张桌子在美学上是美丽的，它的白色是白色的，带有黑色甲板上衣。它很坚固。确实花了一些时间来整理，因为有很多小零件和乏味的作品。我们遇到的问题是，我们缺少五个手柄和所有带有手柄的螺钉。非常沮丧。我联系了卖方，他们最初回答说，由于零件没有库存，零件要花7到15天才能订购并发送出去，或者我可以购买零件，他们将向我偿还30美元。我建议他们将超过30美元。我将不得不尝试找到并非您的传统手柄和所有带有手柄的螺钉的匹配手柄。我要求退还50美元，因为这在不得不前往不同商店以查找匹配或紧密匹配的零件之外更合适。卖方向我退还50美元。根本没有争论。我唯一希望的是卖方很快沟通，但这没关系。对桌子及其外观感到满意，非常适合学习。卖方是专业的，没有辩论来纠正这种情况。	Y		"Size: 30""H | Color: Off White"	4	16	1.0	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SkFF6sKmL._SY200.jpg			https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2W2QEQ8YXPRJ5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQM7RH4X	jazmyn	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGD36AGKP4YHNHA57HK45E663OFQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2024-09-17

B0D7MLB18H	Not worth the money. Falling apart after a month and a half with minimal use.	不值得钱。一个半月后崩溃，最少使用。	"I've had this desk only since July and within two months the desk has started to fall apart with *minimal* use. The drawers are sagging, the door doesn't sit straight, the top part is lifting and the screws on the underside are falling off by themselves.

For a desk that is over 300 dollars I am incredibly disappointed with the quality. I'm having to replace it now and am frustrated by having to do so. Save your money, look at another desk. Not only does it not have cutouts in the back for wires, but the drawers are incredibly short as well with so much wasted opportunity for extra storage space, and the construction of the desk, regardless of how well you put it together, is clumsy and lackluster at best and will fall apart.

Ive ordered so many 'build at home' furniture pieces from amazon and have never had issues with items falling apart even after aggressive use. For instance, my vanity and my bedside tables. I abuse those pieces and they have held together amazingly.

As for this? Don't bother. It looks nice in the photos but even when assembled following the instructions to a T, it is very unstable, very ill put together with screws and nuts falling out and the drawers leaning to the sides. Ultimately, its completely cheap and cheap looking in person."	"我只有7月以来才有这张桌子，在两个月之内，桌子开始随着 *最小 *的使用而崩溃。抽屉下垂，门不直，顶部是举起，底面的螺钉自身掉下来。

对于一张超过300美元的桌子，我对质量感到非常失望。我现在必须替换它，因此必须这样做感到沮丧。节省您的钱，看另一台桌子。它不仅可以在电线后面的切口，而且抽屉也很短，而且浪费了很多额外的存储空间的机会，而且桌子的构造，无论您将其放在一起，都很笨拙，而且很笨拙，而且充其量只是平淡无奇，会崩溃。

我从亚马逊订购了这么多“在家中建造”家具，即使在积极使用后，物品也从未崩溃。例如，我的虚荣心和床头桌。我滥用了这些作品，它们令人惊讶地结合在一起。

至于这个？不要打扰。它在照片中看起来不错，但是即使按照说明进行了组装，它也非常不稳定，非常生病，将螺丝和坚果掉下来，抽屉倾斜到侧面。最终，它的外观完全便宜。"	Y		"Size: 30""H | Color: Dark Brown"	1	18					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AWE30HPL81BW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQM7RH4X	Aliya	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEY7PEDVMQC7M2QXQXJEYLZCDZTA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2024-09-09

B0CQM7RH4X	Damage	损害	"Update 9/5/2024 @ 10:23 AM PST
I received the product with no instruction manual and the item was damaged.

I'm sure i will like it once it's assembled. The desk seems durable.
I feel like giving it three stars. I will update this once i assess the kind of support i get.
Its not fair to give a poor rating simply om the condition of the item. I am unsure if the item was pre-opened.
It must have been though right? 🤔  so i guess the rating includes how the seller handles their product.
_____________________
So far I am receiving outstanding support. I will not beat up the seller for damage that may have been caused by shipping. I upgraded the stars to 3. I will update my review again once i assemble the desk.
_____________________
9/9/2024
Ok. So i have upgraded the stars from 3 to 5. As i mentioned before, i had suspicion that shipping is what caused the damage on the product. I looked at the video and now have proof that it was the shipping as they carelessly take the product out of the truck.
The seller did an impeccable job resolving an issue that they did not cause. i hope the shipping companies are compensating sellers for damage.
The actual furniture is amazing. I love it!"	"更新9/5/2024 @ 10:23 AM PST
我收到了没有说明手册的产品，该物品损坏了。

我敢肯定，我会喜欢它。桌子似乎耐用。
我想给它三星级。评估得到的支持后，我将更新此信息。
给出差的评级不公平，只需将物品的状况带来。我不确定该物品是否已预开。
一定是对吗？ 🤔因此，我想评级包括卖方如何处理其产品。
 _____________________
到目前为止，我正在获得出色的支持。我不会因运输可能造成的损害而击败卖方。我将星星升级到3。组装桌子后，我将再次更新我的评论。

好的。因此，我将星星从3升至5。我看了视频，现在有证据表明这是运输，因为他们不小心将产品从卡车上取出。
卖方做出了无可挑剔的工作，解决了他们没有引起的问题。我希望航运公司对卖方赔偿损失。

B0D7M3PVWJ	Nice desk; assembly takes a long time.	漂亮的桌子；组装需要很长时间。	I really like this desk. It seems very sturdy and a good size.

It did take nearly 6 hours to completely assemble, but in the end I am very satisfied with this desk.	我真的很喜欢这张桌子。看起来非常坚固，尺寸很好。我会阅读有关磨损和划痕的评论，因此我选择了浅棕色，希望可以轻松触摸任何划痕。到达时只有几个最小的瑕疵。确实需要将近6个小时才能完全组装，但最终我对这张桌子感到非常满意。	Y		"Size: 30""H | Color: Warm Brown"	5	9	4.0	"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71tsLXG+rQL._SY200.jpg

B0CQM7RH4X	A nightmare	一场噩梦	"41 pages of assembly instructions, over 50 parts and 7 hours later and the desk still is not right.

SCREWS to put on handles not included.  Stuck with drawers with NO HANDLES.
Drawers will NOT CLOSE all the way.  Wrong drawer sliders.
WHITE VENEER is just PAPER  It is already peeling.
FOLDERS have to be bent in order to fit them in FILE DRAWER.

I do volunteer work on my computer all day every day.  They advertise ""easy to assemble."" This desk was supposed to be something special for me.  Instead, it has become a nightmare.  And I cannot afford another $350 to buy another one."	"41页的组装说明，超过50个零件，7小时后，桌子仍然不正确。

螺钉不包括手柄。被没有手柄的抽屉卡住。
抽屉不会一直关闭。抽屉滑块错误。
白色贴面只是纸，它已经在剥落。
必须弯曲文件夹才能将其适合文件抽屉。

我每天整天都在计算机上进行志愿工作。他们宣传“易于组装”。这张桌子应该对我来说很特别。相反，它已成为一场噩梦。而且我买另外350美元的价格。"	Y		"Size: 30""H | Color: Off White"	1	6	4.0	"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41XkiCEbvUL._SY200.jpg

Additionally, as other reviewers wrote about how long it takes to put the desk together, it took my husband an entire day.  I would have looked at a different desk had I realized how small the drawers were."	这是一张漂亮的桌子。但是，抽屉是个玩笑。它们很小 - 很小，以至于您不能将12英寸的统治者放在正常位置。我丈夫非常精明地做东西，并认为他可以使用抽屉的前部并使背部更长。如果没有，我可以做到这一点工作直到我可以买到新的桌子，因为其他评论者写了多长时间，我丈夫一整天都会看着另一个桌子。 。	Y		"Size: 30""H | Color: Off White"	3	5	3.0	"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+XRRBZEjL._SY200.jpg

B0CQYRGX2T	Work with no distractions	没有干扰	"Surprisingly satisfied with the end product. I've spent 20+ years as an aviation mechanic and now as a Quality Engineer. It took me 2 days with approximately 4 hours each day (8hrs total) with several interruptions from my 4 year old wanting to help... if not for that I probably could have completed in 6hrs by myself. You need 2 people to lift the top on the desk... trust me.

The instructions say don't use a power tool like a drill... if you have a good one with different settings use it or don't. I chose to use mine at the 3 lowest power settings, no issues. With that said packaging was a little banged up but everything seemed to be in good order and there's a ton of pieces to sift through. I find they don't provide enough glue for the dowel pins, so if you have some wood glue handy use it. This is probably the most time consuming part of the build. The fasteners they provide don't all necessarily fit flush with the wood and the stickers they provide to cover it don't stay in place long and will also not sit flush on fasteners that are not flush. Also, the items are dirty like industrial dust and smell like a sweat factory.

I've seen a video of someone saying they couldn't install the drawers because missing sliders, that individual doesn't understand what they were doing.  Even though the instructions say to peice those sliders together they actually come attached to eachother which can be confusing, meaning you have to seperate the 2 halves first by pushing on the tab. 1 goes on the drawer and the other in the desk. You can actually see this in the video of both halves installed on desk side only and the guy doesn't understand what he has to do. These are the negatives that come to mind a month later.

Took a bucket of warm water and detergent with a wrung out wash cloth and cleaned unit. Everything went together with relative ease. It just takes a little time at certain points and you must closely observe the pictures to understand what you're to do. Overall the negatives are minor and I like the look and functionality of the desk, it's worth the time and money."	"令人惊讶的是对最终产品感到满意。我已经担任航空机械师20多年了，现在是一名质量工程师。我花了2天的时间每天大约4个小时（总共8个小时），我4岁的几次中断想提供帮助...如果不是那样，我可能自己可以在6小时内完成。您需要2个人来抬起桌子上的顶部...相信我。

说明说，不要使用诸如钻头之类的电源工具...如果您有一个具有不同设置的好方法，则使用它。我选择在最低的3个功率设置上使用我的，没有问题。有了那个包装有些撞击，但一切似乎都处于良好状态，并且有很多零件可以筛选。我发现它们没有为销钉销提供足够的胶水，因此，如果您有一些木胶方便的使用。这可能是构建中最耗时的部分。他们提供的紧固件并不一定都与木头和贴纸贴上贴纸不一定要覆盖不久，也不会保持长时间，也不会坐在不齐平的紧固件上。另外，这些物品像工业灰尘一样肮脏，闻起来像汗水厂。

我看过一个视频，有人说他们无法安装抽屉，因为缺少滑块，那个人不了解他们在做什么。即使指示说明这些滑块在一起，它们实际上是彼此依附的，这可能会令人困惑，这意味着您必须首先通过按下标签来将这两个部分分开。 1在抽屉上，另一个在桌子上。实际上，您只能在仅安装在桌子侧的两个半部分的视频中看到这一点，而那家伙不明白他必须做什么。这些是一个月后想到的负面因素。

用一桶温水和清洁剂，用拧干布和清洁的装置。一切都相对轻松。这只是在某些方面需要一点时间，您必须密切观察图片以了解您要做什么。总体而言，底片很小，我喜欢桌子的外观和功能，这是值得的时间和金钱。"	Y		"Size: 76""H | Color: Off White"	4	5					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RG626E3RJJPEV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQM7RH4X	SARAH	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFZGOAIL66VKU6ZN23NCSUYW3OFA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2024-07-08

B0CQYRGX2T	Great new additions to the home office	家庭办公室的新增加	"Very happy with my purchase. Will be using the products to create a new home office.
Me and my husband have built multiple products that use the same assembly accessories.
 To build all three products took us around 6 hours.
The assembly instructions are included and they have pictures for every step and details of what tool and hardware that will be needed.
Only issue with the instruction manual I found was for the desk… there is a misprint. It jumped from step 5 to step 8. But no worries, just a simple typo.

The most time consuming process is when you need to use the Hex key.
Definitely recommend two people to assemble. Someone to check the pictures with you and make sure you are putting the parts in the correct direction.
Once everything is assembled, the products are slightly heavy. So another recommendation is to build close to where you want to display the products.
Overall highly satisfied with the purchase. Sturdy, durable, and they have a functional design."	"对我的购买非常满意。将使用产品来创建新的家庭办公室。
我和我的丈夫已经建造了使用相同装配配件的多种产品。
制造这三种产品大约需要6个小时。
包含包装说明，并为每个步骤以及需要哪种工具和硬件的图片进行图片。
我发现的说明手册唯一的问题是给桌子……存在错误的印刷。它从步骤5跳到步骤8。但是不用担心，只是一个简单的错字。

最耗时的过程是您需要使用十六进制键。
绝对建议两个人组装。有人与您检查图片，并确保将零件朝正确的方向放置。
一旦所有东西组装在一起，产品就会稍大。因此，另一个建议是建立您要显示产品的位置。
总体而言，对购买非常满意。坚固，耐用，并且具有功能性设计。"	Y		"Size: 76""H | Color: Off White"	5	9	1.0	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vVhBjS0YL._SY200.jpg			https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EZ46AW05TB6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQM7RH4X	Stacy	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH57PTI7X26TMDI2G3LGPFAEBA4Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2024-06-17

B0CQM7RH4X	Free your day. Maybe 2	免费的一天。也许2	"Item arrived ahead of schedule and in perfect condition despite rough handling by PedX (our guy talks on the phone held to his ear by his shoulder while delivering :(), was in perfect condition. For those who think comments about the crazy high number of pieces, it is astounding. All were well marked. We had exactly one bad screw, but no big deal as there were extras.

Got a bit more than halfway through (up to putting on top) the first day after about 5 hours. Second day was about 4 hours. On the 3rd day I took apart some bits that I had installed in reverse. The instructions are pictographs and mostly good, but there are a few pieces that can be installed one of two ways, and I did that (twice - yeah, not proud). For reference, be careful with the orientation of part #2. It's obvious once you see it, but the instructions aren't helpful here.

While 80% is just standard Philips screwdriver, there are a couple of places where a short handled or right angle screwdrivers is a necessity. Good hex keys are a big help. You can do it with the little ones they provide, but it's way harder than it needs to be.

Tried to ignore the comment about power screwdrivers, but indeed they would not drive any screws successfully. Your hand and wrist are going to be sore when you're done.

But the good news is that it looks great. It's incredibly sturdy so lots of good engineering there.

The drawers are indeed really short, for reasons that are not clear. But there are 5 of them, so that helps. Not using it for files, so that part didn't impact me.

Recommended. But have patient friends and give yourself a LOT of time. Worth it though."	"尽管PEDX进行了粗暴的处理，但项目提前了，状况良好（我们的家伙在交付时在他的肩膀上靠在他的肩膀上说话:(）的状态非常完美。碎片令人震惊。

大约5个小时后的第一天，已经有了一半以上（直到登上顶部）。第二天大约是4个小时。在第三天，我拆开了一些我反向安装的位。这些说明是象形文字，大多是很好，但是可以安装几件作品之一，我做到了（两次 - 是的，不自豪）。为了参考，请小心第2部分的方向。一旦看到它，很明显，但是这里的说明在这里无济于事。

虽然80％只是标准的飞利浦螺丝刀，但在几个地方，必须使用短角度或直角螺丝刀。好六角钥匙是一个很大的帮助。您可以与他们提供的小孩子一起做，但比需要的要难。

试图忽略有关电动螺丝刀的评论，但确实不会成功驾驶任何螺丝。完成后，您的手和腕部会疼痛。

但是好消息是它看起来很棒。它非常坚固，所以那里有很多好的工程。

出于尚不清楚的原因，抽屉确实很短。但是其中有5个，所以有帮助。不将其用于文件，因此该部分不会影响我。

受到推崇的。但是有耐心的朋友，给自己很多时间。值得。"	Y		"Size: 30""H | Color: Off White"	5	18					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QT7BY8ZZ24OC/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CQM7RH4X	Lou J.

B0CQYRGX2T	It looks nice, but is less functional than I'd like.	它看起来不错，但是比我想要的不力。	"This piece took about 8 hours for one person to put together and seemed to have about 1000 pieces, it was a daunting process but the instructions were easy to follow. The desk came with printed stickers to cover the screws but the stickers don't stay put very well on their own. Overall, I like the desk, it looks great, but there are somethings I don't care for, for example, the upper cabinets are very tall and rather useless without a second set of shelves unless I stack everything.

The main thing I dislike about this desk is that the drawers are only about half as deep as the desk itself, they are extremely small and should be much longer. Also, the entire thing is particle board/MDF, some of which arrived slightly peeling."	"这个人花了大约8个小时才能组合在一起，并且似乎有大约1000件，这是一个令人生畏的过程，但说明很容易遵循。桌子上带有印刷贴纸来覆盖螺丝，但贴纸并不能独自一人保持很好。总的来说，我喜欢桌子，看起来很棒，但是有些我不在乎，例如，上橱柜很高，而且没有第二组架子，除非我堆叠一切。

I wish the large drawer was wide or deep enough for hanging file folders, but all the drawers are only 11 inches deep.  I was able to put a hanging file folder rack in the cabinet with a door though.  I did have to remove the shelf to do so.

Other than the short drawers, I love the desk and have received lots of complements.

Oh, by the way, it weighs 127 pounds, so you'll need a couple of guys to lift the box to put it where you want.  There are LOTS of pieces, but the instructions were good and it was not hard to put together.  It just took a long time because of the amount of pieces."	"我爱桌子。看起来很棒！我希望所有抽屉都和桌子一样深。它们比桌子短。

我希望大抽屉宽或足够深，可以悬挂文件夹，但是所有抽屉都只有11英寸深。不过，我能够用门将悬挂的文件夹在柜子里放置。我确实必须卸下架子才能这样做。

除了短抽屉外，我喜欢桌子，并获得了很多补充。

You get what you pay for. Overall though, once completed it does look nice. And my wife is happy with it. Just know you’ll be putting in a lot of work to put it together.

B0CW9CFPYM	Three days to assemble	三天组装	This desk comes in a lot of pieces to put it all together. I personally like to use glue and it could be assembled a little bit quicker without the glue. Glue makes it much more sturdier when completed. Overall fitment was really good, trying to decipher the wordless directions took a little bit of doing. Just beware that it will take some time to assemble.but  overall, the end result was very nice. I was able to do it completely by myself, but I would suggest having a second person to help on occasions. A magnifying glass will certainly help with the directions and if you’re going to use glue, keep a damp rag handy to clean up any excess before it dries.	这张桌子有很多碎片将其整合在一起。我个人喜欢使用胶水，并且可以在没有胶水的情况下更快地组装。胶水完成后使其更加坚固。总体上的装修真的很好，试图破译无言的方向花了一点时间。请注意，组装需要一些时间才能组装。但是总的来说，最终结果非常好。我自己能够完全做这件事，但我建议有第二个人在有时提供帮助。放大玻璃肯定会有助于指示，如果您要使用胶水，请在干燥之前保持潮湿的垃圾用来清理多余的多余。	Y		Size: Desk | Color: Black	4	2					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JMSCC2I8NFPS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CW9CFPYM	Lee	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/95f0c9ff-68ca-4ba4-8cdf-cc011398e071._CR0,0,456,456_SX48_.jpg	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEN7U5YASDHJZHYKMLXFFZWHWHCQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2024-08-26

For another star, the instructions are absolutely terrible, please prepare to figure out building this desk on your own. Many of the diagrams do NOT show all holes/slits that certain pieces have so it can be easy to identify, nor do they label where each piece such as screws will go, so you have to guess which part is going to go where. For your sake, I hope your parts come properly labeled since I had to figure these out for myself to get to where I am.

I will keep my review at a three because the desk might actually still be sturdy in the end of things, but if it isn’t, I’m dropping this to a one-star because I will have to dismantle this thing and truck it to a refund location. Please take care in your manufacturing of parts and re-do your instructions to be more user-friendly."	"我什至还没有完成桌子，它只是装满了零件缺少的贴纸和粗糙的碎片。这将等同于我去除一颗星星。

B0C7KMF7L2	Solid Desk for the Price, with a Few Minor Drawbacks	固体桌子的价格，有一些小缺点	"I purchased the Tribesigns 71"" Executive Desk primarily because it checked all the boxes for what I needed: affordable, L-shaped configuration, black/gray wood motif, and the perfect size for my space.

The build quality is decent, I'd rate it a C+. It's mostly pressboard, and the wood grain is obviously a digital print, so it doesn't have that high-end, premium feel. There are also some exposed screws on the front, which detract a bit from the overall look. That said, it has a nice door with soft-close hardware, which is a nice touch. The desk is very wide, which is great if you need space to work—there’s plenty of room for two people to sit across from each other with a computer in the corner.

One thing to note is that one side of the desk isn't really meant to be exposed, so you’ll want to plan accordingly for your setup. The biggest downside for me was the assembly time. It took about 3 ½ hours to put together, which was longer than I expected. However, the instructions were clear and all the parts were well-labeled, which definitely helped.

Overall, I’d give this desk a 4/5. It meets all my needs and looks great in my office, but it's not a premium piece of furniture. If you're looking for something affordable and functional, this is a solid choice."	"我之所以购买了部落71英寸高管台，主要是因为它检查了所有盒子的所需内容：负担得起的L形配置，黑色/灰色木材图案以及适合我的空间的完美尺寸。

构建质量是不错的，我将其评级为C+。它主要是压力板，木纹显然是数字印刷品，因此它没有那种高端的高级感觉。前部也有一些裸露的螺钉，这有点损害整体外观。也就是说，它有一扇漂亮的门，上面有软粘硬件，这是一个不错的选择。桌子非常宽，如果您需要工作空间，这很棒 - 两个人有足够的空间彼此坐在拐角处坐在彼此之间。

要注意的一件事是，桌子的一侧并不意味着要暴露，因此您需要相应地计划设置。对我来说，最大的缺点是集会时间。组合大约花了大约3½个小时，这比我预期的要长。但是，这些说明很明确，所有零件都标有良好的标签，这肯定有帮助。

总的来说，我会给这张办公桌4/5。它满足了我的所有需求，在我的办公室里看起来很棒，但这不是高级家具。如果您正在寻找负担得起且实用的东西，这是一个可靠的选择。"	Y		Color: Grey	4	19			Y	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/vse-vms-transcoding-artifact-us-east-1-prod/417789cb-ac24-4027-b1fc-43dce129a35b/default.jobtemplate.mp4.480.mp4	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4DYKMU3IFZCK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C7KMF7L2	H.

It looks professional, it looks amazing, and for the price its literally unbeatable. (I went to all the furniture stores in town and everything was 5x the price and less sturdy/beautiful), so this is definitely the one.

I am a seasoned IKEA assembly guy.
I've assembled sketchy chinese bootleg furniture as well in the past.
I've assembled quite literally anything imaginable and have all the professional tools at home ready for anything.

But this............. This table........... I have never cussed so much in my entire life while building anything. I think my neighbours heard my cuss in 5 languages that evening I was assembling it.

I had to re-assemble it from the beginning once (Literally deconstruct and assemble again) due to their assembly explanation.

Imagine showing you ONE picture, putting ALL the pieces there, showing what to use then saying - go.
WHAT???
Now okay, some pictures are somewhat understandable, but then they skip a few steps? Suddenly they have planks ALREADY attached in the next pic? Which planks? What screws? I literally had to be sherlock holmes and find the clues and figure out exactly which screws to use.
It was absolutely insane. They skip steps, they just show you a picture and expect you to use your imagination, but the one that got me even more irritated was when the picture shows the table flipped on its side, and explains how and where to put screws..... Except the flipped table is covering (literally) the holes where you gotta put the screws with its planks, and the only way to get there would be digging an underground tunnel and getting to that screw location. L M F A O . I literally had to flip the table (again) carefully, while holding and juggling the other planks from not being ripped out, then placing it safely on another side to reach the spot where I had to screw the screws in.

I CAN'T EXPLAIN HOW HORRIBLE THE ASSEMBLY IS. IT'S HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So please, if you are willing to have your entire neighborhood hear you cuss, and you have a boxing sandbag nearby for stress relief (You'll need it every 5mins while assembling this), and you are also ready to semi lose your mind - THIS IS THE ONE FOR YOU!

Because after all that suffering... You ARE getting the perfect table. The perfect most beautiful and sturdy desk.

Oh and I forgot that their pictures showed which holes to use for the door of the cabinet inside the table.......... THEY LIED. You have to use the other ones, otherwise the door will not work properly.

smh."	"好的，这张桌子很棒。这是我想要的一切。它看起来很专业，看起来很棒，而且价格实际上是无与伦比的。 （我去了镇上的所有家具商店，一切都比价格占5倍，而且坚固/美丽），所以这绝对是那家。

我是一个经验丰富的宜家大会的人。
过去，我也组装了粗略的中国盗版家具。
我已经组装了几乎可以想象的任何东西，并在家准备了所有专业工具。

但是这个.......................................................我一生中从未在建造任何东西时都陷入过多。我认为那天晚上我正在组装5种语言的邻居听到了我的混乱。

由于它们的组装解释，我不得不从一开始就重新组装它（实际上是解构并再次组装）。

想象一下，向您展示一张图片，将所有的作品放在那里，显示要使用什么 - 去。
什么？？？
现在好的，有些图片有些可以理解，但是他们跳过了几步？突然，他们在下一张照片中已经附着木板吗？哪个木板？什么螺丝？从字面上看，我必须是夏洛克·福尔摩斯（Sherlock Holmes），找到线索并确切地找出要使用的螺钉。
这绝对是疯狂的。他们跳过步骤，只是向您展示一张照片，并期望您使用自己的想象力，但是让我更加恼火的是，当图片显示桌子翻转的时候，并解释了如何以及在何处拧紧螺丝... ..除了翻转的桌子覆盖（从字面上）您必须用木板放螺钉的孔，到达那里的唯一方法是挖地下隧道并到达该螺丝位置。 lmfao。从字面上看，我不得不（再次）仔细地翻转桌子，同时握住和杂耍其他木板，以免被撕开，然后将其安全地放在另一侧，以到达我不得不拧入螺钉的位置。

我无法解释大会有多恐怖。太可怕了!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

因此，如果您愿意让您的整个社区听到您的声音，并且附近有一个拳击沙袋，以缓解压力（在组装时，每5分钟就需要它），并且您也准备半场失去理智 - 这是适合您的！

因为毕竟遭受了痛苦……您正在获得完美的桌子。完美最美丽，最坚固的桌子。

哦，我忘了他们的照片显示了桌子内柜门的哪些孔..........他们撒谎。您必须使用其他门，否则门将无法正常工作。

B0C7KMF7L2	Perfect desk	完美的办公桌	I really love this desk. It's very sturdy, even though it's not real wood I like getting stuff from Tribesigns/Tribdesigns because they do a good job of using a material that feels much sturdier and reliable than a lot of cheap wood furniture. The surface is very easy to clean, it's got a great layout with plenty of room to store items and plenty of leg room. I also wanted a desk that had my monitor far enough away from me that it doesn't fry my eyes, but also gives me room to put a notebook in front of me to write on without having to move everything around. This took care of everything. My only complaint is I wish the desk had a built in hole for cords, but that's not a big deal at all. I would get this desk again in a heartbeat.	我真的很喜欢这张桌子。它非常坚固，即使它不是真木，我也喜欢从 Tribesigns/Tribdesigns 买东西，因为他们在使用的材料方面做得很好，感觉比很多便宜的木制家具更坚固可靠。表面非常易于清洁，布局很好，有足够的空间存放物品和充足的腿部空间。我还想要一张桌子，让我的显示器离我足够远，这样它不会刺伤我的眼睛，但也给我空间，让我可以在面前放一个笔记本来写字，而不必移动所有东西。这解决了所有问题。我唯一的抱怨是我希望这张桌子有一个内置的电线孔，但这根本不是什么大问题。我很快就会再次得到这张桌子。	Y		Color: Grey	5	2					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QAZ8UY5Z3EX6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0C7KMF7L2	Ryan V	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGEIDMTCO7J74UDRKKJQ2TOKDMEQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2024-03-04

B0C7KMF7L2	Difficult to Assemble	很难组装	"Love the desk. It's perfect. It is not small and it looks professional.

I was very disappointed in the assembling of the desk. I have assembled several box furniture and what I hate is when the instructions are partial and you have to figure it out. for someone who does not know these pins, it would be a disaster.

The pins are not the problem, The pieces have labels, screws alphabetically, and part numbers. The instruction tells you to place numbers one to two and so on, but it does not say fit side 1 to side 2 or they did not ensure that there is a left side or right side, or the front side or back side, you have to figure this out yourself. three times during the fitting-up process I had to remove a piece because both sides were the same, had the same holes and only the top to bottom was different.

The under-desk front shelf has the same size screws to anchor the shelf to the frame. This is absurd because they are so short. it will not hold the shelf in place. I had to find some longer old screws and use them to anchor the shelf. Please see the photos attached."	"爱桌子。这是完美的。它并不小，看起来很专业。

引脚不是问题，零件具有标签，字母顺序的螺钉和零件编号。该指令告诉您将数字一到两个等等，但并不是说合适的侧面为1到2，或者他们不能确保有左侧或右侧或前侧或背面，您有自己弄清楚。在拟合过程中，我不得不取下一件，因为双方都相同，有相同的孔，只有上到底是不同的。

底层前架的尺寸相同，可以将架子固定到框架上。这是荒谬的，因为它们太短了。它不会将架子固定在适当的位置。我必须找到一些较长的旧螺钉，然后用它们固定架子。请查看附带的照片。"	Y		Color: Grey	3	6	3.0	"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Mb0Qx468L._SY200.jpg

My girlfriend and I like our new desk a lot. It’s sturdy, has a good amount of storage, and has plenty of work space for anything that we might need to accomplish. Unfortunately our biggest peeve with the desk is the top work space which has a gap in between the fake marble looking board and the regular black board (see photos). It’s not a good feeling to spend hours building a heavy desk by yourself only to find the product to be faulty at the end. Kind of a bummer but it’s here so we’ve been giving it a shot. We love everything else about this desk so far. I was able to build it myself, but having two people would have been tremendously easier."

我和我的女朋友非常喜欢我们的新桌子。它坚固，拥有大量的存储空间，并且有足够的工作空间适合我们可能需要完成的任何事情。不幸的是，我们在桌子上最大的繁荣是顶级工作空间，它在假大理石外观板和常规黑板之间存在差距（请参阅照片）。花几个小时自己建造一个沉重的桌子不是一个好感觉，只是发现该产品在最后是错误的。有点令人讨厌，但它在这里，所以我们一直在拍摄它。到目前为止，我们喜欢这张桌子的其他一切。我自己能够建造它，但是有两个人会变得非常容易。"			Color: Brown	4	5	6.0	"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716yAItldgL._SY200.jpg

B0C7KMF7L2	Wow. Nicely designed and quality	哇。设计精美，质量	I've bought too many disks to count over the years.  This time, moving to a new house, I wanted a nice setup that was well made.  I always need L shaped desks because of the tasks that I do and equipment around me, scanners, printers, head sets, lamp, Bible reading, and this one exceeded my expectations.  First off, I've had the desk for weeks before my move and the two boxes are HEAVY.  Arrived on different dates but didn't bother me.  Instructions weren't clearest but just read and use common sense and logic and it's not bad.  This thing fits so well together that it seems like a solid piece of furniture.  The storage compartments are excellent for putting my scanner out of sight, laptop and shredder.  My office looks clean.  I hope I never move again because I don't want to take this apart or ever have to replace it.  Great product.  My only gripe is there should be pop in covers for the few open visible holes where the screws are installed. Not a biggie, I can grab something or paint it black.	这些年来，我买了太多的磁盘以计算数。这次，搬到新房子，我想要一个很好的设置。我总是需要L形桌子，因为我所做的任务以及周围的设备，扫描仪，打印机，头部，灯，圣经阅读，这超出了我的期望。首先，我的桌子持续了数周，然后两个盒子很重。到达不同的日期，但没有打扰我。说明不是最清楚的，而只是阅读和使用常识和逻辑，这还不错。这个东西非常适合在一起，看起来像是一件坚实的家具。该储物室非常适合将我的扫描仪置于视线，笔记本电脑和碎纸机之外。我的办公室看起来很干净。我希望我再也不会搬家，因为我不想将其拆开或不得不替换它。很棒的产品。我唯一的gripe是，应该在安装螺钉的几个开放式可见孔中盖上盖子。不是一个大的人，我可以抓住东西或黑色。	Y		Color: Grey	5	14	2.0	"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/810VTv3GEuL._SY200.jpg

B0CLTN4LX6	Mislabeled parts on cabinet	机柜上贴错标签的部件	"The one star is not for the desk itself, it’s for the mislabeling of all of the parts for the cabinet. The desk went together nicely and all parts were included. I like it and it seems sturdy.
The file cabinet that came in a separate box was a nightmare. At first I thought there were 5 missing pieces, but it turned out that all of the parts and hardware were mislabeled.  Also, there were pieces included that weren’t in the manual or list of parts. It would appear that they changed the parts but didn’t send an updated manual. My brother (engineer type) was able to “wing” it and put it together, but most people would not have been able to.  Now that it’s together, the cabinet itself is nice.  Again, the one star isn’t for the desk and cabinet but for the mislabeling of parts and instruction manual."	"一颗星不是针对桌子本身，而是针对橱柜的所有部件贴错标签。桌子叠得很合，所有部件都包括在内。我喜欢它，而且它看起来很坚固。

However, the instructions to put it together are the worst. The drawer connection pieces also used the cheapest old version of these which are a little more complicated.  They should have used the wheeled version of drawer attachments which are simplest.  I also feel like it is overpriced by at least $100 now that I've looked at other similar options.

We also bought another similar one for another office which was 60% cheaper and cost $120, which was just as sturdy and well designed.  Just had slightly thinner compressed boards. Overall, I'm happy with the desk itself but would not recommend it or purchase it again for the reasons above."

B0BQYP8JS2	While I love it, assembler BE PREPARED	虽然我喜欢它，所以汇编器做好准备	"Let me start by saying, I love this desk and the completed project. It's perfect for my space and what I needed to upgrade.

With that being said, the assembly leaves a lot to be desired. There are NO words on the booklet. It took me almost 30 minutes to figure out how to disassemble the tracks for the drawers to get them on their respective parts.  Personally, these should ship on the drawers/walls already to make it easier.  The steps in the booklet are completely out of order. Do yourself a favor and skip ahead and assemble each drawer, etc individually to make sure you're properly aligned before you get ahead and realize you flubbed step 2 and need to go back.  Don't do the way they do it.  But also be mindful you may need to adjust the tracks again. My top drawer was crooked so I had to remove it, adjust the track down and fit it in.  It can be tricky to get all the parts to align.  That said, this mom did the whole thing alone. The cabinet took longer than the desk, for sure. My one drawer is slightly off but it closes and you can't tell unless you're looking for it.  Its pretty good quality for the money.  Very sleek design. Shipping was great-does come in 2 boxes that may not arrive together!

Would recommend but just be prepared to put in some elbow grease. And the tracks pull apart - if that saves anyone time and mental head slapping 🤣🤣"	"让我开始说，我喜欢这个办公桌和完成的项目。它非常适合我的空间和我需要升级的内容。

话虽这么说，所以大会有很多不足之处。小册子上没有话。我花了将近30分钟的时间才弄清楚如何拆卸抽屉将它们放在各自的部位上的轨道。就个人而言，这些应该在抽屉/墙壁上运送，以使其更容易。小册子中的步骤完全没有秩序。帮自己一个忙，跳过前进，组装每个抽屉，等等，以确保在领先之前正确对齐，并意识到自己燃烧的步骤2并需要返回。不要按照他们的方式做。但请注意，您可能需要再次调整轨道。我的顶部抽屉是弯曲的，所以我必须将其卸下，调整轨道并将其安装。使所有零件保持对齐可能很棘手。就是说，这个妈妈独自做了整个事情。机柜肯定花了比桌子更长的时间。我的一个抽屉有点关闭，但它关闭了，除非您正在寻找，否则您无法分辨。这笔钱的质量很好。非常时尚的设计。运输是伟大的，这是两个可能无法一起到达的盒子！

会建议，但要准备放入一些肘部润滑脂。曲目拉开 - 如果这节省了任何人的时间和心理耳光🤣🤣"	Y		Size: 55 inches | Color: Grey	4	3	2.0	"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71k1wSvFV8L._SY200.jpg

B0CMCD8RPG	For around $300…You get what you pay for.	售价约300美元，您可以得到您所支付的费用。	"The cabinet takes a little time to assemble. They look great and work well. The wheels are not that good. I would recommend replacing them with a stationary foot from your local hardware store.

The Desks are easier to assemble. Depending on what you get, the top edges may not line up. I bought 3 of these and only 1 lined up great. You can ‘thump’ them with a rubber mallet to adjust and improve the fit. I had one desk that had a hole in one of the parts (Delivery damage). Also some lines/stain flaws on the same desk. (See video)

The Suppler is easy to talk to. They offered 2 options: 1-a A new table top part (Several weeks to get) or 2- A $40 discount. I took the discount. Overall, I’m happy with the desk sets."	"机柜需要一些时间来组装。他们看起来很棒，工作得很好。车轮不是那么好。我建议您用当地五金店的固定脚代替它们。

桌子更容易组装。根据您获得的内容，顶部边缘可能不会排列。我买了其中3个，只有1个排队很棒。您可以用橡胶槌“重击”它们以调整和改善贴合性。我有一张桌子在其中一个零件中有一个洞（交货损坏）。另外，同一张桌子上的一些线条/染色缺陷。 （请参阅视频）

补品很容易与之交谈。他们提供了2种选项：1-新的桌子顶部（几个星期）或2美元的折扣。我折扣了。总的来说，我对桌子套装感到满意。"	Y		Size: 63-inches | Color: Walnut	4	11	2.0	"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71XZqDmp+JL._SY200.jpg

B0BQYP8JS2	Great product. Even better seller	很棒的产品。甚至更好的卖家	First, I would like to say I do not usually leave reviews for products and this is a product review but more so a seller review as well. The desk is very solid and looks very nice for the price. Do not expect a mahogany executive desk set for the penthouse and you will be well pleased. It is very functional and very easy to put together. The shippers treated it like a rag doll yet the packaging was sufficient enough to protect it from any damage. Now, on to the real reason I am writing. I wrote with a question about only one package arriving and got a quick response from the seller and had the second tracking number in a few hours. I also sent pictures of the rough boxes and the seller said if there were any issues let them know and they would promptly fix the issue. They are a great company to do business with and will happily buy from them in the future. Thanks for a great experience and product.	首先，我想说我通常不会留下产品评论，这是产品评论，但更卖家评论。桌子非常坚固，价格看起来非常好。不要指望桃花心木的高管台为顶层公寓，您会很高兴。它非常有用，很容易组合在一起。托运人将其视为抹布娃娃，但包装足以保护其免受任何损坏。现在，出于我写作的真正原因。我写了一个关于只有一个包装的问题，并从卖家那里得到了快速回复，并在几个小时内获得了第二个跟踪号。我还发送了粗糙盒子的图片，卖家说，如果有任何问题，请告诉他们，他们会立即解决该问题。他们是一家很棒的公司，可以与他们开展业务，并将在将来很高兴地从他们那里购买。感谢您的出色经验和产品。	Y		Size: 55 inches | Color: Grey	5	12					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KSRY82RKDFJG/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMCD8RPG	Michael	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE6IFTE2UET6XW6MSV7WJZ3NAGDA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2023-09-01

B09BCRCGS2	Buyer Beware Difficult Assembly Ahead	买家要当心困难的集会	This desk is well designed and sturdy and is a practical solution for storage, and it looks exactly as pictured. HOWEVER it does not have good assembly instructions and the way it is written , or should I say not written...there are pictures, few words , if any and a complete lack of useful ones...as in right, left, top, bottom, etc. To begin with, you have to attach the casters on the base of the storage unit and as I found to be the case in all the places that required screws , they sre not pre-drilled, there are marks where the screws should go, but this material is very hard to screw into...especially in some of the positions where the screws must be used..so the four caster markings did not match the hardware holes and thus it was hard to line up the screws and hard to screw them in. The limited directions and the lack of pre-drilled screw holes makes this much more difficult and time-consuming than it should have been. note: the last part of the drawers on the storage unit piece , what should been the easy part, installing the handles...was made more complicated because the screws that are packaged with the handles do not work, There are others in the box that do. Still, an annoying issue but is easily fixed once you figure it out.	这张桌子设计精良且坚固，是用于存储的实用解决方案，看起来完全如图所示。但是，它没有良好的汇编说明和书写方式，或者我应该说没有写...有图片，几个单词，如果有的话，并且完全缺乏有用的内容...如右，左，顶部，底部等。首先，您必须将脚轮安装在存储单元的底部，正如我发现在所有需要螺钉的地方都是如此，它们没有预先钻出，有一些标记螺钉应该掉，但是这种材料很难拧入...尤其是在某些必须使用螺钉的位置中。钻孔的螺丝孔使它比原本应该更加困难和耗时。注意：存储单元上的抽屉的最后一部分，应该简单的部分，安装手柄……变得更加复杂，因为用手柄包装的螺钉不起作用，盒子中还有其他螺丝就是这样。不过，这是一个烦人的问题，但是一旦您弄清楚了。	Y		Size: 55 inches | Color: Brown	3	10					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DTX9MWZ39CT6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMCD8RPG	Marion Giroux	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGTRTRGSOKSPHEULROUEWPBHIYVA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2022-11-29

B09BCRCGS2	Great art desk set	伟大的艺术桌子套装	This desk and cabinet set is great! I needed a big desk to paint watercolors on and storage for all my supplies. This is perfect. The ledge underneath the desktop fits my art organizers and so does the space under the cabinet top. It was fairly straightforward assembly and organized well- they even give you a full-size screwdriver in each box. But the two boxes it arrives in are super heavy since it’s solid wood and metal. We had to drag the boxes inside and take pieces up two at a time and my husband had to wrestle the tabletop piece upstairs. Aside from that, it’s a perfect set. I can’t wait to paint a watercolor with all this space to spread out. I highly recommend this desk.	这张桌子和橱柜套装很棒！我需要一张大桌子来上水彩画并为我的所有物资储存。这是完美的。台式机下方的壁架适合我的艺术组织者，橱柜顶部下方的空间也是如此。这是相当简单的组装，组织得很好，他们甚至会在每个盒子里为您提供全尺寸的螺丝刀。但是它到达的两个盒子非常沉重，因为它是实木和金属。我们不得不将盒子拖到里面，一次将盒子拿起两个，我的丈夫不得不在楼上摔跤桌面。除此之外，这是一个完美的组合。我等不及要在所有这些空间散布的水彩画。我强烈推荐这张桌子。	Y		Size: 55 inches | Color: Brown	5	7	4.0	"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-yBCD+2CL._SY200.jpg

	The ultimate puzzle	终极难题	The wood quality is excellent, but the sheer number of pieces—over 100—makes assembly a nightmare. The box is extremely heavy, making it difficult to move around the house. Unfortunately, mine arrived damaged and broken, and after spending nearly an hour unpacking it, the frustration was overwhelming. To make matters worse, I now have to deal with a return process that requires me to cover the shipping costs, despite the item being defective. Given its weight, handling it alone is nearly impossible, adding to the overall hassle. If you don’t mind spending an entire day building a puzzle, then go for it!	木质质量非常好，但是巨大的碎片（100块）使组装一场噩梦。盒子非常重，很难在房子周围移动。不幸的是，我的到达损坏和折断了，花了将近一个小时的拆箱后，挫败感令人难以置信。更糟糕的是，我现在必须处理一个返回流程，尽管该物品有缺陷，但仍需要我支付运输费用。鉴于其重量，单独处理它几乎是不可能的，这加剧了整体麻烦。如果您不介意整天建立难题，那就去吧！	Y			1	0	3.0	"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RYu37eLxL._SY200.jpg

Another frustrating issue is that the product photo in the listing does not match the desk I received. In reality, it looks different, and the quality is far from what was advertised.

Returning it is also a big problem for me because I would have to repack and transport it myself. The desk is very heavy, and as a woman, it is difficult for me to handle on my own.

I do not recommend this product as it does not match the description and arrived with defects."	"我对此电脑台的购买感到失望。首先，桌面有一个芯片，其中一个角落损坏了。此外，桌子的腿也有缺陷。

	BUY IT, SO WORTH IT!!!😌	买它，值得！！！	I was hesitant at first given the reviews on how difficult it would be to build, however I am glad I caved and bought it. This desk is really nice, the wood is quite solid and thick, and there are many dowels, screws, and brackets that keep the desk together. As far as the instructions go, they were only in picture form but were simple to figure out. There are many pieces to put together, so it did take around 5 hours of building; given the sturdiness I’d say it’s well worth the time. My only issue was the slider drawer pieces- the instructions were not clear on that, and the bigger top beam connecting the drawers to the cabinet above the desk is slightly curved. Comfortable desk well worth the money and has lot of storage space! 10/10 recommend.	鉴于对建造有多困难的评论，我最初很犹豫，但是我很高兴自己掌握并购买了它。这张桌子真的很好，木头非常牢固且厚实，并且有许多销钉，螺丝和支架可以将桌子放在一起。就说明而言，它们仅是图片形式，但很容易弄清楚。有很多零件可以放在一起，因此确实需要5个小时的建筑物。考虑到坚固，我会说这是值得的。我唯一的问题是滑块抽屉片 - 说明尚不清楚，而将抽屉连接到桌子上方的柜子的较大顶部横梁略有弯曲。舒适的桌子值得一提，有很多存储空间！推荐10/10。	Y			5	2	3.0	"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713sntKbvbL._SY200.jpg

B0DDC2LZG8	Great sturdy desks! 4.75 Stars	很棒的桌子！ 4.75星	"Beautiful desks! I got both the L-shaped desk and then the one with double sided drawers for my home office. They take a while to build, but the process is fairly easy and instructions very clear. They are absolutely gorgeous and offer great storage, the drawers roll smoothly and I absolutely love the color. The listing notes ""army green"" or ""green-gray"" as the color, but they are mainly a dark gray with maybe a hint of green undertone. Do not be thrown off by that! I dock it a quarter of a point because in the L-desk - the file hanging drawer rods are improperly placed. They cannot hang a letter sized file folder since the rods are too far apart. I routed another pocket for the rod to sit in with my drill and a routing bit to solve this issue, but it does require a little extra work. The double sided drawer desk does not come with a file hanging drawer on the left like I thought which I think is a miss. But overall, these desks are stunning and sturdy and I am very happy with my purchase!"	美丽的桌子！我拿到了L形的桌子，然后是一个带有双面抽屉的桌子。他们需要一段时间才能构建，但是过程相当简单，说明非常清楚。它们绝对华丽，可以提供出色的存储空间，抽屉顺利滚动，我绝对喜欢这种颜色。列表将“陆军绿色”或“绿色灰色”视为颜色，但它们主要是深灰色，也许是绿色的底色。不要被那扔掉！我将其停靠了四分之一，因为在L -Desk中 - 放置了文件悬挂的抽屉杆。他们不能悬挂一个字母大小的文件夹，因为杆相距太远。我用另一个口袋坐着，让杆坐在钻头和一个路由钻头来解决此问题，但确实需要一些额外的工作。双面抽屉桌没有像我想的那样在左侧的文件悬挂抽屉，我认为这是一个错过。但是总的来说，这些桌子令人惊叹，坚固，我对购买感到非常满意！	Y		"Size: 33.5""D X 67""W X 36.5""H | Color: Grayish Green"	5	11	5.0	"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IRDkwlsAL._SY200.jpg

B0D7HZBXHV	Too many pieces...	太多的碎片......	I liked this style and based on previous reviews that it was 'easy' to put together I bought it. The thing is it has tons of pieces and very time consuming to put together. The instructions are there but very little wording...only pictures and some are very hard to determine which way things go. After two day...I took a break and maybe 10 hours total it was finally finished. It looks nice. Drawers are a bit tight but maybe they will loosen after use. It also weighs over 95 pounds and I'm 74. So it was a pain to get down to my apartment. Some of this could have been pre-put together I think.	我喜欢这种风格，根据之前的评论，它“很容易”组装起来，我买了它。问题是它有很多部分，组装起来非常耗时。说明在那里，但措辞很少......只有图片和一些很难确定事情会走向何方。两天后...我休息了一下，总共大概 10 个小时终于完成了。看起来不错。抽屉有点紧，但使用后可能会松动。它的重量也超过 95 磅，而我今年 74 岁。所以回到我的公寓很痛苦。我认为其中一些可能是预先放在一起的。	Y		Color: Grey	2	0					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1W64A46ICNCRU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCND83GD	B.

B0D7HZBXHV	No assembly instructions *Updated-pretty good!	没有组装说明 *更新-相当好！	"Please note the package comes in one box. Very heavy! Also, I had to contact the manufacturer for assembly instructions. Will update review once instructions arrive, but until then, 1/10. Only positive is that I’m excited about maybe finishing this desk. Pictures look great.

**Update**
The manual was sent over chat with the manufacturer very, very promptly, so I can’t hold that part against them too much.

All in all, a wonderful, sturdy desk. Bit of work to put it all together, but they did leave extra screws and other pieces in case of misplacement, I guess. It took me a whole Sunday to set up at my leisure, but I took lots of breaks and was distracted with TV and food. It could probably be put together in about two hours or so if you’re focused. It wasn’t hard to figure out but there were a lot of steps. The desk contains 34 pieces.

The drawers are well built and close quietly. The top is a strong piece of wood that has four 3-pronged outlets, two usb ports, and a manual reset switch like on a surge supply.

The design is classic and the colors modern. I’m a fan!"	"请注意，包装装在一个盒子里。很重！此外，我必须联系制造商以获取组装说明。一旦说明到达，将更新评论，但在那之前，1/10。唯一的积极因素是，我对可能完成这张桌子感到兴奋。图片看起来很棒。

**更新**
该手册是通过与制造商的聊天非常非常及时发送的，所以我不能对这部分有太多的反对。

总而言之，这是一张美妙而坚固的书桌。把它们放在一起需要做一些工作，但我猜他们确实留下了额外的螺丝和其他部件，以防放错位置。我花了整整一个星期天的时间才在闲暇时进行布置，但我休息了很多次，被电视和食物分散了注意力。如果您集中注意力，它可能可以在大约两个小时左右完成。这并不难弄清楚，但有很多步骤。书桌包含 34 件。

抽屉结构精良，关闭安静。顶部是一块坚固的木头，有四个 3 孔插座、两个 USB 端口和一个手动复位开关，就像浪涌电源一样。

设计经典，色彩现代。我是粉丝！"			Color: Grey	4	0					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7T6X5M0K2K5B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DCND83GD	Ryan H.	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGE5AWH2VJDSDFHE55RT4NZTULRQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2024-07-13

	I love this desk	我爱这个桌子	I love this desk and the cabinet that goes with it but there are flaws with the file cabinet section. Mine was replaced after arrival because of broken pieces and chips in the desktop, but the new desk is fine. Very sturdy, scratchproof. Best desk you can find in my opinion, but the file cabinet section needs help. 5 months after new one was received from being replaced the file cabinet started caving in on itself. There is no middle support underneath, so the weight lifted the top off of it as it bowed down on the bottom middle section. The drawers and bottom shifted so much without being overloaded that it came apart. I did have insurance on it, I just wish flaws in it could be fixed so it did not collapse as I loved this set. I will keep the desk as it is beautiful. and works well. It is very nice and worked for me for a while.

B0B62LVT9Y	The lateral file cabinet is very difficult to assemble. Be prepared to spend two hours or more	横向文件柜很难组装。准备花两个小时或更长时间	"The product is sturdy enough, although felt smaller in real life than it appears in the pictures. The desk is pretty straightforward to put together, but expect to be severely challenged when putting together the lateral file cabinet.
The instructions are a problem. They are purely pictorial, with no written instructions or explanations. The pictures themselves are of poor quality and leave a lot of detail out, which leaves you to try to figure things out yourself. Some of the information in the instructions are outright wrong, for example, they list ""W6"" screws for one of the steps when it should have been ""W1"". and they illustrate two #4 panels, while in fact, you are supposed to work on both sides of a single #4 panel.
I consider myself pretty handy, and have a plethora of tools, including a power drill (which they recommend not using), but it took me two hours to put the thing together (not counting the time it took me to figure out that the drawer glides need to come apart-not indicated in the instructions).  I hate to imagine how long it will take if you use the supplied hand screwdriver!
You will also likely need an assistant as there are a couple of steps that are difficult to do alone, and you risk damaging the parts if not held properly in place. Finally, because of the multiple parts, complexity and time it takes to put it together, you will need to do the work on a table or other raised platform, or your back will give out before you finish!
In summary, this item is for the type of person who relishes the prospect of assembling a taken-down BMW engine with little or no instructions."	"该产品足够坚固，尽管在现实生活中感觉比图片中看起来要小。桌子很简单地放在一起，但预计将侧面文件柜放在一起时会受到严重的挑战。
说明是一个问题。它们纯粹是绘画，没有书面说明或解释。图片本身的质量很差，并且没有大量细节，这使您可以自己弄清楚东西。说明中的某些信息是完全错误的，例如，它们列出了本应为“ W1”的步骤之一的“ W6”螺钉。他们说明了两个＃4面板，而实际上，您应该在单个＃4面板的两侧工作。
我认为自己很方便，并且拥有大量工具，包括电力钻（他们建议不要使用），但是我花了两个小时将这些东西放在一起（不计算我花的时间来确定抽屉花的时间滑行需要到达说明中未指示的）。我讨厌想象，如果您使用提供的手螺丝刀需要多长时间！
您可能还需要一个助手，因为有几个步骤很难单独执行，并且如果不正确地固定零件，则可能会损坏零件。最后，由于将其放在一起的多个部分，复杂性和时间，您将需要在桌子或其他凸起的平台上进行工作，否则您的背部将在完成之前散发出来！
总而言之，此项目适用于喜欢组装陷入困境的宝马发动机的前景的人，几乎没有或根本没有指示。"	Y		Size: 55 | Color: Walnut	2	1					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39UPNBH9NQBAK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMJ1R8MS	Bill	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFPCXIRZUEVW7NXCC2ARAZ4U6JIQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2024-12-04

B0B62LVT9Y	You dont need a uzi to assemble. You’ll need it after	您不需要Uzi即可组装。之后你需要它	"Don’t let the price fool you . I should have bought a lower cost desk. I’m almost finished assembling the side desk with the drawers. Took me about 6 hours total and I’m not finished yet. So no need to wait till that point. Can’t wait for the other half. It may be quicker who knows. Maybe I just got that one trashy one out of the lot. I did not watch any of the tutorials. I usually listen to music or just enjoy silence. I’m decent when it comes to figuring things out. I almost always find a solution fairly quick. This side desk has been a dumpster fire.

The booklet with the instructions is trash. The pictures are odd . I did one of those maybe I’m reading the instructions upside down type of actions. I’m 43 I’ve assembled lots of furniture.

The holes where the m15 x 12 go are so bored out you have to hold them in place while tightening them or else they just fall out. The pictures don’t look like the parts. They probably switched contracts in the middle and it was just a free for all with assembly instructions. Some instructions are there and some of them are my own. I’ve already busted out the glue as well as the drill. I will say once it is assembled how ever it’s done is solid . You can tell people were exhausted setting up the pre fab stuff. Nothing quite lines up.

Im obviously keeping it I have destroyed it out of anger yet and it’s heavy I’m not dragging it to the ups store. Hire someone to assemble for you or don’t by it.
If you have kids and you’re not sure if they can handle life . Have them assemble this in a day and if it is functioning you can let them leave. I’m so mad about this I hear nothing at the moment."	"不要让价格欺骗你。我应该买一张较低的成本桌子。我几乎用抽屉组装了侧桌。我总共花了大约6个小时，但我还没有完成。因此，无需等到这一点。等不及另一半了。知道的人可能会更快。也许我刚刚得到了一个垃圾。我没有看过任何教程。我通常听音乐或享受沉默。在弄清楚事情方面，我很体面。我几乎总是很快找到解决方案。该边桌一直是垃圾箱大火。

带有说明的小册子是垃圾。图片很奇怪。我做了其中之一，也许我正在阅读颠倒的操作类型。我已经43岁了，我组装了很多家具。

 M15 x 12的孔非常无聊，您必须将它们固定在适当的位置，同时拧紧它们，否则它们才掉下来。图片看起来不像零件。他们可能在中间切换合同，这只是所有带有组装说明的免费合同。有一些说明，其中一些是我自己的。我已经淘汰了胶水和钻头。我会说，一旦将其组装在一起，它的完成方式是牢固的。您可以告诉人们设置Pre Fab的东西很耗尽。没有什么可以排队了。

我显然保留了它，我已经因为愤怒而摧毁了它，而且很重，我没有将其拖到UPS商店。雇用某人为您组装或不这样做。
如果您有孩子，并且不确定他们是否可以应付生活。让他们在一天之内组装，如果运行起来，您可以让他们离开。我为此很生气，目前什么都没听到。"	Y		Size: 55 | Color: Walnut	2	1	1.0	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/517cLHb1pyL._SY200.jpg			https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RH2QLRMGTNLL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMJ1R8MS	Douglas Ritchie	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGKP55VQPLACHIZ5XCX557KMBALQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2024-06-02

The help line consisted of an operator who took your email address and were told you'd be contacted sometime within 24 hours by email only.  Total waste of time and frustrating especially if you have the pieces placed all over the room.  The instructions did say to make sure you have all the pieces BEFORE you start construction.
If Tribesign would provide clearer drawings,
written instructions and suggest using a screw gun (which I did use), construction would be easier.
This is a nice looking sturdy desk.  The credenza is particle board so I will wait and see how it holds up in a humid area."	"桌子很容易放在一起。 1小时。信条没有； 5.5小时。这些说明只是图纸不是很清楚。没有书面说明。

B0B62LVT9Y	Fantastic! Love this desk and cabinet!	匪夷所思！喜欢这个桌子和橱柜！	I had to review this product because the reviews were mixed and almost turned me off from ordering these pieces.  I'm so glad I didn't!  The desk was super easy to assemble (by myself) and very sturdy and nice looking.  I may get another one.  The filing cabinet was a bit more tricky, but after a helpful call to the Tribesman customer center, I was directed to a very helpful video that quickly answered my question and I was able to continue assembling the cabinet (by myself) with little issue.  Note, the directions only have pictures so it was great that there was a video available.  All-in-all, even though it took me nearly all day to put the pieces together, I would definitely buy this product again.  This is probably the first time that all of the holes lined up properly and I had all the pieces.	我不得不评论这个产品，因为评论褒贬不一，几乎让我无法订购这些作品。 我很高兴我没有！ 这张桌子超级容易组装（我自己），而且非常坚固，看起来不错。 我可能会再买一个。 文件柜有点棘手，但在给 Tribesman 客户中心打了一个有用的电话后，我被引导到一个非常有用的视频，它很快回答了我的问题，我能够继续组装柜子（自己），几乎没有问题。 请注意，路线只有图片，所以有视频可用真是太好了。 总而言之，尽管我几乎花了一整天的时间才把各个部分拼凑在一起，但我肯定会再次购买这款产品。 这可能是第一次所有孔都正确对齐并且我拥有所有部分。	Y		Size: 55 | Color: Walnut	5	3					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3V5SAV2J1ABN7/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMJ1R8MS	Cheryl G.	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFMSU427OEC7WTAJTBP44GF7PT5Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2024-03-22

B0CMJ1R8MS	BEWARE… YOU WILL LIKELY BE DISAPPOINTED	小心。。。你可能会失望	"Very disappointing. The included instructions do not match the pieces and when you finally figure out how to assemble it you will be left with many parts. It hardly resembles the photos and description provided.

It comes in two heavy boxes. We opted to return the desk and while the request was approved we were sent a single return label using the US Postal Service, without postage. The USPS would not take it due to the weight and there was only one label for two boxes.

When we originally called AZ to intervene, we were told they would arrange with the seller to pick it up and provide the correct UPS labels.we were expected to hear from someone within 72 hours. 96 hours later we had to call AZ again who told us the China based company had not responded and our only option was to arrange with UPS to pick it up and provide AZ with the receipt at which time AZ would reimburse us for the shipping.

If you enjoy cheap, poorly made furniture that comes at a premium price - this item is for you.

Us… we ordered online from IKEA and the desk was less expensive and beautifully made…. And more importantly, the instructions matched the parts perfectly."	"非常令人失望。随附的说明与各个部分不匹配，当您最终弄清楚如何组装它时，您将留下许多零件。它与提供的照片和描述几乎没有相似之处。

它装在两个沉重的盒子里。我们选择退回服务台，虽然请求获得批准，但我们收到了使用美国邮政服务发送的单一退回标签，无需邮资。由于重量，USPS 不会接受它，而且两个盒子只有一个标签。

当我们最初打电话给 AZ 进行干预时，我们被告知他们会安排卖家取货并提供正确的 UPS 标签。我们预计会在 72 小时内收到某人的回复。96 小时后，我们不得不再次致电 AZ，他们告诉我们中国公司没有回应，我们唯一的选择是安排 UPS 取货并向 AZ 提供收据。时间 AZ 会报销我们的运费。

如果您喜欢价格昂贵的廉价、制作粗糙的家具 - 那么这款商品适合您。

B0CMJ1R8MS	Don't recomend	不推荐	I found the instructions incredibly unhelpful. It took my husband and myself over 3 hours to put this together. I had to refer to the overall put together piece and guess what went where. Holes didn't align, and one wasn't even threaded so I have a free floating bar.

The Filing cabinet DOES NOT have the proper drilled holes, and will take your personal screws and power tools to assemble.

Assembly time moved up from what should've been a two hour assembly to about a 5-6hr assembly to put together the cabinet. The desk is together in about 10 minutes.

I'd say the value for the money is awful, the grey wood finishing pieces of the desk are the only redeeming quality, I like the height and color of the desk, but would've gone with something else had I known the construction troubles I had to go through.

B0B62LVT9Y	Desk is great, lateral cabinet is quite different	桌子很棒，侧柜完全不同	"The two pieces--the desk and the lateral file cabinet--are quite different.  The desk rates 5 stars, but I have dropped my overall review by a star because of the lateral file cabinet.  I'd still buy it, but see below for more details.

First, the desk is extremely solid, and well packaged--maybe even over-packaged, considering it's mostly steel and almost impossible to damage.  It went together easily, and looks good.

Second, the lateral piece.  This is made entirely of pressed wood, and as such is less sturdy.  It's well made, but in my experience pressed wood can develop issues with the fasteners.  While it was thoroughly packed in Styrofoam, one piece arrived damaged: There was minor (really cosmetic) damage to one corner, but more importantly the rail (that the drawer slides on) had broken entirely off.  I wrote to customer service, expecting they would ship a new piece; instead, they suggested I repair it, and offered a hefty partial refund if I would do that.  When I got it in my shop, I realized that all three screws holding the rail had pulled out, leaving holes in the pressed board that would not reliably hold the screws.  I went ahead and put those screws back in, but used wood glue to give it more strength.  I then realized that there were additional holes in the rail, so I drilled small holes in the pressed board and used three more #6 screws there.  I am confident this will hold up, and the partial refund was nice.

The instructions for assembling the desk were great; not so the instructions for assembling the lateral piece.  Here are notes I made as I went along, keyed to the steps in the instructions.  Some are probably obvious, but just in case.

Pieces W-3 are in a plastic bag.  A few of them somehow locked together during shipment (see my photo), and were difficult to separate.  I found that a screw driver in each piece was needed to separate them.

Pieces W-5 are shown in the parts diagram but are not mentioned in the instructions, and are not needed.  I think they were for the handles, but the handles come in a bag with their own screws.

2. Make sure piece #4 is lined up with the front of piece #1, and does not cover the groove at the back of #1 (it's possible to get #4 backwards).  Also, pieces W-2 go into *both* sides of piece #4, unlike the instructions which show W-2 on only one side.  Screw these pieces in evenly on the two sides (it's possible to screw one side in too far, then the other won't go in far enough).  Insert these screws *before* inserting piece #3 (pieces 2 and 4 will tilt far enough to fit #3 in, provided you insert the posts on one side of piece #3 before trying to line up the other side).

3. Again, pieces W-2 go on *both* sides of piece 5, and make sure the front of #5 lines up with the front of #1.

5. Make sure piece #8 goes *all* the way down in the groove in piece #1, or you'll have difficulty later.

6. It's unclear from the diagram, but piece #16 fits along almost the entire length of the lower and upper pieces #8.

7. There are no pre-drilled holes for the screws, which is why my caution at step 5.  Best to ensure that both #8 pieces are down as far as they can go before using the screws.  The top #8 should stick up about 1/4"" over pieces 2, 4, 5 and 7.

8. There's a lot to line up here: not only the W-2 pieces sticking up, but also piece #8 has to go into the groove in the bottom of #9 all the way across.  Easiest is to line up all the W-2s, then slightly screw in the W-3s at the front, then make sure #8 is in the groove before screwing in the back W-3s.

10. The instructions don't mention attaching the handles, although I guess it's obvious.  However, the screws that hold the handles on are slightly too long.  I used washers on the inside to make up the difference.

In the end, everything went together.  There are a few extra screws and stuff (in addition to the above-mentioned W-5s), which is nice.  The result looks nice, the desk is sturdy, and the lateral file cabinet rolls easily (even on a rug)."	"两块 - 桌子和横向文件柜 - 完全不同。该桌子的评分为5星，但由于侧面文件柜，我放弃了一颗星星的整体评论。我仍然会买，但是请参阅下面有关更多详细信息。

首先，桌子非常牢固，包装得很好，甚至超过包装，因为它主要是钢，几乎不可能损坏。它很容易融合在一起，看起来不错。

其次，侧面。这完全由压木制成，因此不太坚固。它做得很好，但是根据我的经验，木材可以与紧固件一起出现问题。虽然它被彻底包装在聚苯乙烯泡沫塑料中，但一件碎片却损坏了：一个角落造成了轻微的（确实是化妆品）的伤害，但更重要的是，轨道（抽屉滑动）已经完全破裂了。我写信给客户服务，期望他们会运送新作品。取而代之的是，他们建议我修理它，并提供大量的部分退款。当我把它放在商店里时，我意识到所有握住轨道的三个螺钉都已经拔出，在压制板上留下了无法可靠固定螺钉的孔。我继续前进，然后将这些螺钉重新放进去，但使用木胶使其更大。然后，我意识到轨道上还有额外的孔，所以我在压制板上钻了小孔，并在那里使用了三个＃6螺钉。我相信这会坚持下去，部分退款很好。

组装桌子的说明很棒。不是这样组装侧面件的说明。这是我继续前进时做的笔记，遵守说明中的步骤。有些可能很明显，但以防万一。

 W-3件在塑料袋中。他们中的一些人以某种方式锁定了装运（请参阅我的照片），很难分开。我发现需要每个部件中的螺丝驱动器将它们分开。

零件图中显示了W-5件，但在说明中没有提及，不需要。我认为它们是用于手柄的，但是手柄带着自己的螺钉放在一个袋子里。

 2。确保＃4与第1件的前部排列，并且不会覆盖＃1背面的凹槽（可以向后获得＃4）。另外，与仅在一侧显示W-2的说明不同，W-2的零件都进入了＃4的两个 *侧面。将这些碎片固定在两侧（可以拧得太远的一侧，而另一侧的一侧不够远得多）。在 *插入＃3之前插入这些螺钉 *（第2和4件将倾斜到足以适合3中的螺丝，只要您在尝试排列另一侧之前，您将柱子插入件＃3的一侧）。

 3。同样，W-2在第5件的两个侧面上进行 *，并确保＃5的前部与＃1的前部排列。

 5。确保第8件＃8都 *全 *在第1部分中的凹槽中向下倾斜，否则您将稍后遇到困难。

 6。从图表中不清楚，但是第16件件几乎符合下部和上层＃8的整个长度。

 7。没有针对螺钉的预钻孔，这就是为什么我在步骤5处的谨慎。最好确保在使用螺钉之前，这两个＃8件都尽可能地降低。顶部＃8应该在2、4、5和7上伸出约1/4英寸。

 8。这里有很多要排队的地方：不仅W-2插件挂起，而且第8件件必须一直进入＃9底部的凹槽。最简单的是对所有W-2排列，然后在正面的W-3中稍微拧紧，然后确保＃8在凹槽中，然后拧入后W-3。

 10。指示没有提及附加手柄，尽管我猜这很明显。但是，固定手柄的螺钉太长了。我用内部的垫圈弥补了差异。

最后，一切都在一起。还有一些额外的螺钉和东西（除了上述W-5），这很好。结果看起来不错，桌子很坚固，横向文件柜很容易滚动（甚至在地毯上）。"	Y		Size: 55 | Color: Walnut	4	9	1.0	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51OX-lR2H5L._SY200.jpg			https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3517H8313MXVO/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMJ1R8MS	Michael B.

B0CMJ1R8MS	Instructions did not match up with drilled holes and guides within the piece.	说明与作品中的钻孔和指南不匹配。	I ordered a desk that needed to be built by November 15.  From the pictures, this was to work extremely well for my needs.  The desk is in two parts.  1--Desk and 2--file cabinets & storage  The desk went together easily following the instruction manual, however, the file cabinets & storage were a different story.  We had 5 different people look at it and we all came to the same conclusion--the holes were drilled in the wrong spots to be put together properly.  Because we needed the desk, we figured out a way to make it work, but it wasn't a finished professional product once we were done.  We requested that the seller provide us with a discount because of the production error.  Their only alternative was to send the entire desk back (after we had already put it together).  If we were to send it back, it would have went to China and cost us more for shipping because of its size, than what it was worth.  The seller refused to get any type of discount for the portion of the unit that was manufactured incorrectly.  We only requested some sort of compensation for the file cabinets & storage portion of the item.  An Amazon customer service representative could not even get them to change their minds.  Very disappointed, especially for the cost.	我订购了一张需要在11月15日之前建造的桌子。从图片中，这对我的需求非常有效。桌子分为两个部分。 1--Desk和2-File橱柜和存储桌子符合说明手册，桌子很容易地一起乘坐，但是，文件柜和存储是另一回事。我们有5个人看着它，我们都得出了相同的结论 - 在错误的位置钻了孔以适当地放在一起。因为我们需要桌子，所以我们找出了一种使它起作用的方法，但是一旦完成，它并不是一件成品的专业产品。我们要求卖方由于生产错误而为我们提供折扣。他们唯一的选择是将整个桌子寄回（我们已经将其放在一起之后）。如果我们要把它寄回，那将去中国，并且由于它的规模而花费的费用要比价值更多。卖方拒绝为制造错误的单位部分获得任何类型的折扣。我们仅要求对项目的文件柜和存储部分进行某种补偿。亚马逊客户服务代表甚至无法让他们改变主意。非常失望，尤其是为了费用。	Y		Size: 63 | Color: Walnut	1	4					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29JRPFZ1HU4O4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMJ1R8MS	Dawn	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE4TTJKCUBYKSRTQBYBKH3K7Q6JA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2023-11-30

B0B62LVT9Y	Great deal!	很棒！	For the price. I was expecting cheap craftsmanship but wow, was pleasantly surprised of the quality and look of both the desk and the cabinet.  Package came in two large boxes, one for the table and other for the desk. Took about 1 hour to assemble the table and 2-3 hours to assemble the cabinet. Mind you, I took my time as I had a 3 yo “helping” me but am sure others will be faster. You’ll need two people to help assemble the cabinet as it is a heavy box and some sections, you’ll need someone to hold the shelves as you screw then in. Overall, I love my new desk and cabinet. I probably would have gotten a larger desk and probably more filing cabinets or closed shelvings but really depends on what you need to store. I ended up buying nice storage boxes to put inside the open shelves to hide some of the mess.	价格。我期待着便宜的工艺，但哇，桌子和橱柜的质量和外观让人感到惊喜。包装放在两个大盒子里，一个用于桌子，另一个用于桌子。花了大约1个小时的时间组装桌子，然后花了2-3个小时来组装柜子。请注意，我花了一些时间，因为我有一个3岁的“帮助”我，但肯定其他人会更快。您需要两个人来组装柜子，因为它是一个重盒，有些部分，您需要有人在拧入然后拧入货架。总的来说，我喜欢我的新桌子和橱柜。我可能会得到更大的桌子，可能会有更多的档案柜或封闭式货架，但实际上取决于您需要存储的东西。我最终买了不错的储物盒，以放在敞开的架子内，以隐藏一些混乱。	Y		Size: 55 | Color: Walnut	5	2					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15415AGNFX0JF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMJ1R8MS	Anthony	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE5NBOPNEAPJRAJBCXL24DOMOJWQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2023-10-26

B0B62LVT9Y	Good product, but...	好产品，但是...	"Let me start by saying that after I had assembled everything and and ""made it work"", I like my desk.  Huge improvement over my old one.  Where Tribesigns falls short is in the customer service experience.

My package arrived with damage to one of the panels for the rolling filing cabinet.  During transit the glider arm for a drawer had been physically ripped free of the wood, leaving behind damage to the drawer.  When I contacted Tribesigns they asked me to install the glider back to the drawer as there appeared to be holes in the glider I could match to the undamaged section of the panel.  I said no, I preferred to have a new part shipped with the original glider in place and undamaged.  They argued that their engineers said I could make it work, that it would take a long time to get the replacement part since they were from China, and finally offered me $30 instead of sending a new part.  After going back and forth with them I tried their suggestion.  The drawer works but drags instead of sliding smoothly like the other drawer does.  I did receive my credit, but that takes a star away.

The other issue is their instruction sheet.  It's full of omissions of steps.  You have to intuitively figure out where to place the screw holders because the pictures don't always show you.  And the drawer pull hardware comes with screws inside the bag that are too long - when tightened to the max, the pull is not firmly seated to the drawer.  Someone else must have complained about it because there was a small bag of screws included that worked, but again no instructions or inclusion in the pictograms.  So there goes another star.

Shipping damage happens - that's not a surprise.  Where vendors earn top marks is how they take care of the customer.  Ultimately this is a good product let down by customer service and technical writing."	"首先，我要说的是，在我组装了所有内容并“使它起作用”之后，我喜欢我的桌子。对我的旧一个。在客户服务体验中，部落不足。

我的包裹损坏了一个滚动档案柜的面板之一。在过境期间，抽屉的滑翔机被物理撕开了木头，留下了对抽屉的损坏。当我联系部落时，他们要求我将滑翔机安装回抽屉，因为在滑翔机中似乎有孔，我可以匹配面板的未损坏部分。我说不，我宁愿用原始滑翔机进行新的零件，并没有损坏。他们认为他们的工程师说我可以使它起作用，因为他们来自中国，需要很长时间才能获得替代部分，并最终向我提供了30美元，而不是发送新部分。与他们一起来回后，我尝试了他们的建议。抽屉起作用，但拖动而不是像其他抽屉一样平滑滑动。我确实获得了信誉，但这把一颗星星带走了。

另一个问题是他们的说明表。它充满了步骤的遗漏。您必须直观地弄清楚在哪里放置螺丝架，因为图片并不总是显示您。抽屉拉力硬件在袋子内部带有太长的螺钉 - 拧紧到最大值时，拉力并不能牢固地坐在抽屉上。其他人一定抱怨它，因为其中包括一小袋螺钉，但象形图中没有任何指示或包含。所以还有另一个明星。

运输损失发生 - 这不足为奇。供应商获得最高标记的地方是他们如何照顾客户。最终，这是客户服务和技术撰写的好产品。"	Y		Size: 55 | Color: Walnut	3	6					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35GZLV4N1CUCD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMJ1R8MS	Ben Harris	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH2YCVTBDKXIAEC4GHM2VDYO7HPQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2023-04-13

B0B62LVT9Y	So easy to put together	很容易组合在一起	"I really like this set. It’s super easy to put together and it’s just the right thing for a small at home office or homework desk. I think you can order these two pieces separately too so if you needed multiple homework stations for the kids you could add on a desk. The quality was better than I expected as far as surfaces. I mean it’s laminate but it’s not the cheapest of stuff. Drawer slides are already installed too. Not that that’s a really big deal but it’s one less thing.
If I had the need I would buy this again.
My only issue was the time it took to get here.  Fed Ex is becoming increasingly unreliable, it showed up on Monday but should have arrived the previous Friday. It was still within the original date range but the tracking said Friday from the beginning so I checked it that morning after making arrangements to be home and all the sudden it said Monday. I cant fault the seller for that. If you don’t mind waiting a bit and it’s not a problem, it is worth it though.  Both items did show up together."	"我真的很喜欢这套。放在一起非常容易，对于家庭办公室或家庭作业的小型办公室来说，这是正确的事情。我认为您也可以单独订购这两件，因此，如果您需要为孩子们​​添加多个家庭作业站，则可以在桌子上添加。就表面而言，质量比我预期的要好。我的意思是它是层压板的，但不是最便宜的东西。抽屉幻灯片也已经安装。并不是说这很重要，但这是一件事。
如果有需要，我会再次购买。
我唯一的问题是到达这里所花费的时间。美联储EX越来越不可靠，它出现在星期一，但应该在上一个星期五到达。它仍在原始日期范围内，但从一开始就说的跟踪说，所以我在安排回家后的那天早上检查了一下，突然之间说。我不能为此指责卖方。如果您不介意等待一点，这不是问题，那是值得的。这两个项目确实一起出现。"	Y		Size: 55 | Color: Walnut	5	5					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R182TBGNJGUMWW/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMJ1R8MS	Julia	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHYBQJ7ZDMILNFI3JC6XEPQABY3A/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2022-10-24

B0B62LVT9Y	Desk looks so nice!	桌子看起来很好！	The desk is higher than I anticipated but that worked out just fine because if I use a raiser for my keyboard, i can use this desk as a sitting (I got a higher chair) and standing desk - BONUS! :)  Also, the side cabinet is so nice and is great storage. I am able to use the desk for my work monitors and equipment and I use the cabinet for storage and my personal laptop on top of it. My work space is so organized and spacy. The finish of the desk and cabinet are beautiful. The desk part are sturdy (the top is nice and thick and heavy/sturdy. Well worth the price. I LOVE my new work space now.	该桌子比我预期的要高，但是效果很好，因为如果我在键盘上使用启动器，我可以将此桌子用作坐着（我有一个更高的椅子）和站立式桌子 - 奖金！ :)此外，侧柜非常好，储藏室也很棒。我能够将桌子用于工作监视器和设备，然后将橱柜用于存放，以及我的个人笔记本电脑。我的工作空间是如此井井有条。桌子和橱柜的饰面很漂亮。桌子的零件很坚固（顶部又好又厚，沉重/坚固。值得。我现在喜欢我的新工作空间。	Y		Size: 55 | Color: Walnut	5	1					https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27SM21X7WPRUE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CMJ1R8MS	John Rutherford	https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png	US	https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHURPQHPHDFX7X3HLYPSGYRXRV7Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8		2022-09-27
