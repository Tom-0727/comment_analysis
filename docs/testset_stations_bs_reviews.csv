1	https://ergonofis.com/en-us/products/sway-standing-desk	David Drake	5	2023-12-15 00:28:25+00:00	Highest Quality, Excellent Purchasing Experience	I purchased the Ergonofis Sway Desk first and foremost because it was one of the few standing/sitting desks available with a smaller desktop (24‚Äùx48‚Äù), which was essential given the limited space I have for a desk setup. While there may be cheaper options available, the solid wood table and stand/mechanism are of the highest quality and from my perspective represent very good value for money. It was simple to program my preferred sit and stand levels and the swipe mechanism for raising and lowering to the set levels is elegant and works very well. My interface with Egonofis staff regarding a minor detail in my order was pleasant, timely and helpful. Delivery to the West Coast went smoothly and assembly was very straightforward based on clear instructions. I also purchased the cable management solution, the matching Desk Shelf and Neat Cabinet, as well as a YouToo Ergonomic Chair to complete my perfect home office. I highly recommend all of these products.		https://judgeme.imgix.net/ergonofis/1702601482__img_0551__original.jpeg?auto=format

The desk arrived at my home as scheduled. I opted to assemble it myself which was a fun experience. The quality of the pieces was immediately obvious. Instructions were extremely clear and all holes pre-drilled, making the process easy. You do need a friend to flip the desk, this is a solid piece of equipment. Operating the desk and programming settings was a pleasure. I do recommend getting the casters to easily move the desk around.		https://judgeme.imgix.net/ergonofis/1700933376__img_2044__original.jpeg?auto=format

Assembly was a breeze clearly, a lot of thought has gone into the design. It stands out with its robust frame, markedly superior to its rivals. The motor is exceptional, effortlessly adjusting to various heights and it's powerful enough to handle my hefty tower, triple monitors, keyboard, and laptop plus it can lift me without a hitch! Setting the preferred sit/stand heights was straightforward. The craftsmanship is evident in the high-quality materials, especially the wooden tabletop. The only drawback is the premium price point, but it's clear you're getting the elite performance of the standing desk world it's the Lamborghini of desks, and that luxury comes at a cost.

Have been using it for a month now and very much enjoying it and how it feels in the space. Admittedly I have really only been sitting and not standing. I also purchased the draw and it looks great but can be a little sticky in the closed flush position, not sure if there is something I can loosen there. I am strongly considering the cable management as well just to keep the floor today. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate in recommending this desk - I upgraded from an IKEA desk and the difference in quality makes this a very worthwhile upgrade.		https://judgeme.imgix.net/ergonofis/1683550032__img_9990__original.jpg?auto=format

I bought it after watching an extensive review of all of the stand up desk brands out there. Many desks are cheaply made and not sturdy, but the ergonofis sway standing desk is solid, sturdy, well-made. I can tell this desk will be with me for a very long time. It was easy to assemble and the motor is so quiet and smooth when operating. The desk surface its self is beautiful and I was amazed at how well everything was packaged when it arrived. You can immediately tell ergonofis put a lot of attention into the smallest of detail. 12/10 recommend!

The holes are pre-drilled and the way the legs secure to the frame without screws is very clever.

Probably one of the best investments, as this is what it is, I have ever done. As someone who works from home, truly upgrading my workspace with this desk is one of the smartest things I have done.\nDelivery and packaging were also spot on. As someone who is not handy at all, building the desk was easy. No problems at all. I don't want to say if I can do, then anyone can....but.......\nThe materials themselves are excellent quality and the colour, I am in love with it. The desk's quality is amazing.

74	https://ergonofis.com/en-us/products/sway-standing-desk	Jackie Hagen	5	2023-03-10 02:13:59+00:00	Best Desk Ever	This is the best desk I have ever used. I have to sit at desks a lot; eight hours at work, and then another 4-5 at home when I am writing novels. I started getting wrist pain and symptoms of carpal tunnel when I realized my posture at my old desk was not the best. Adjusting the chair and trying foot rests did not help, either. But with the Sway Desk, I am able to adjust everything to the perfect height, and furthermore, I am not forced to sit for the entire time. I am still getting used to the fact that I can actually stand while working now (I have to remind myself), but each time I do, it fills me with so much relief and happiness. I wish I would have bought this desk years ago. I have not felt any pain since.

76	https://ergonofis.com/en-us/products/sway-standing-desk	M.S.	5	2023-02-06 16:35:28+00:00	The Perfect Desk! With a single design flaw w/ the cable management system/ front-mounted power bar	------------\nPROS\n------------\nAs far as desks go, this one is as close to flawless as it gets. I have a lot of respect for Canadian engineers. As opposed to the standard office desks built in the USA or China, this one is far superior. The engineering team gave careful consideration to all aspects of the design that could affect the desk's practicality on a daily basis, including cable management, which is often neglected. Do I really need to gush about how great Ergonofis is at keeping your work area neat and tidy? Please don't take me lightly. Whoever was responsible for keeping all cords hidden and providing more options to take this to the next level of cable management did a fantastic job. A heartfelt debt of gratitude and congratulations to the whole group!\nThe desk's quality is unparalleled: it's made of solid wood, has a gorgeous polish, looks stunning, is built to last, has sturdy, high-grade hardware, and its touch bar is responsive and pleasant to use. Once you've taken the time to familiarize yourself with the touch bar's controls, your workstation will be a breeze to use.\nErgonofis put a lot of care into the assembly process. The difficulty in writing user-friendly and precise instructions is a common complaint among furniture manufacturers. Ergonofis nailed it once again. After unpacking all the components‚Äîwhich came in five different boxes‚Äîit took me no more than an hour to assemble the desk.\nExtras are required but optional. The convenience of the drawer's extra space is indispensable. In the future, I will never purchase a desk that doesn't have one. The Ergonofis is the only desk I ever want to own. Additionally, cable management must be an available option. It performs a fantastic job of letting you conceal every cable you otherwise couldn't. Since I dabble in music production in my spare time, you can imagine my shock at discovering how many wires are required for a proper studio. As part of the cable organizer, you'll find a power bar with nine outlets. It's also a very well-planned layout. Greatly facilitates the concealment of the multitude of power cords that would otherwise be seen behind the desk. A front-mounted power/usb bar is also required, in particular when using mobile devices. There's a good reason why it isn't set up in the photo or clip. And now we'll examine these shortcomings.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nCONS/ ISSUES ENCOUNTERED\n-----------------------------------------------------\nThe extra features are the only reason I'm not completely satisfied with this desk's design. The first thing you'll notice is that I've secured two screens to the surface of my desk. In any case, the cable management system made it really challenging for me to set them up. Why? Because there is a big protrusion of about 4 inches from the cable management system. In most cases, a c-clamp is used to attach the mount to the desk. With that control system in place, installing extra screens is next to impossible. Because of the desk/cable management system, I had to redesign the c-clamp to work with it. I finally got it to function after giving it a lot of thought. However, not everyone will be able to do it. The post-design considerations of ergonomics for the use of such desks with integrated hardware are important. If I hadn't used the cable management system, I would be fine with it. However, I absolutely require the cable organizer.\nFinally, there's a problem with the front-mounted power/usb bar's low-quality construction. The directions for using this were dreadful. The width of the drill bit required to make the four holes should be specified in the directions. There should be a depth requirement in the written directions. These requirements are listed on the desk guide, but not for the power bar. To add insult to injury, the screws are both fragile and flimsy. All four screws broke off at the head and are now permanently embedded in the desk. This isn't a major concern because it's on the underside of the desk, and I can always drill new holes to accommodate new screws. The problem is that I'm out of screws, and I need the kind that won't break off at the head while screwing into the wood. Hopefully Ergonofis will contact me to fix this.\n------------------------\nCONCLUSION\n------------------------\nBuying this desk is a no-brainer, so if you're on the fence about it, stop. Not doing so would be a mistake. Those who, like me, spend a lot of time at their desks will find this to be an excellent purchase. What you're paying for is quality and/or engineering. In a heartbeat, I'd go out and buy this desk again.		https://judgeme.imgix.net/ergonofis/1675701329__img_3416__original.jpeg?auto=format

89	https://ergonofis.com/en-us/products/sway-standing-desk	Bryan Reed	5	2024-10-07 23:52:42+00:00	A Great Desk, Standing or Otherwise	"I've been in the market for a few years for a quality standing desk. I looked at other brands including some options at our local IKEA as well as the less expensive competitors. I am 6'5"" so height and quality were both important to me. \nHeadline: Worthy the price. I splurged and went with the Walnut, grommets, and the drawer. \nThe desk feels like a luxurious. The motor is whisper quiet. It very much accomodates my 6'5"" frame. I put the desk together solo and was able to manipulate the 30"" by 60"" with relative ease. I took my time assembling, given the quality and not wanting to mess anything up. It took about 90 minutes total, reading and re-reading the directions, watching the video, etc. I highly recommend reading through the entire install manual before touching anything. There are a few places where rushing could cause issues.\nFor accessories, the drawer was a no-brainer. I think the grommets really add to a clean aesthetic. I skipped the Ergonofis cable management and standing pad in lieu of some less expensive Amazon.com options that I think are as functional and elegant. I do recommend a standing pad. I used the desk for two days before using one and noticed a big difference in my endurance level. I also added some magnet hooks to house my work bag and a few accessories."		https://judgeme.imgix.net/ergonofis/1728345162__tempimagebgpxcu__original.gif?auto=format	https://judgeme.imgix.net/ergonofis/1728345170__tempimagea5ar7o__original.gif?auto=format	https://judgeme.imgix.net/ergonofis/1728345177__tempimage4fmdtr__original.gif?auto=format	https://judgeme.imgix.net/ergonofis/1728345184__tempimagectuens__original.gif?auto=format

It's sturdy, the mechanics work well, and it's beautiful.\nThe only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that the hardware for the legs and the cable management system are too close to the edge of the desk, so I can't mount my accessories properly.  \nMy stands for monitors, mic, and webcams all require a few inches of exposed edge to securely mount to the desk (as well as a few inches of vertical clearance for the screwing handle).  I only have a couple of small areas left that work for me to mount these devices.  I've made it work, but it's not ideal.\nIf they corrected this, it would be a perfect desk!

I've ended up with a premium quality desk, very sturdy, with almost no cables in sight (I am obsessed with cable management). Additional to the desk, I went for the double monitor arms - one for the monitor and other for a second laptop by having the laptop mount - and right now I couldn't be happier with this set up.

Not having had a standing desk before I was a bit uncertain of the benefits - but I realise now I should have had one years ago!. The build quality is exceptional, and unless you are a strong individual, you'll need a hand putting it together. \r\n\r\nSome handy tips;\r\n- Wire it up BEFORE you put the cable tray cover on.\r\n- Definitely use a monitor arm, it'll save a ton of space if you have a bigger curved monitor. \r\n- The magnetic desk holders are really good (I'm getting more)	United Kingdom					https://cdn.stamped.io/tr:h-800:/uploads/photos/63085_6825890283594_6c7df029_a335_4d93_b1b4_7985e5e0cbb4.jpg?	https://cdn.stamped.io/tr:h-800:/uploads/photos/63085_6825890283594_f63944bf_381e_4118_9ae1_7fdacd31c4cf.jpg?	https://cdn.stamped.io/tr:h-800:/uploads/photos/63085_6825890283594_b6566c37_2142_461d_8b06_74f0bd58f71a.jpg?

I purchased a Secretlab Premium PC Mount without realizing that they are only compatible with the Sitting/Standing Magnus Pro and not the standard desk.

I don‚Äôt see myself ever needing to replace it. It‚Äôs pretty sturdy, very heavy, and quite aesthetically pleasing.\r\n\r\nMy only complaint is the cable management tray being difficult to get at once the monitor riser is in place. Not losing any marks for this though, as I don‚Äôt see there being a way around it. It‚Äôs because of this that there are some loose cables on my desk however, so some care is needed if you end up with a similar set of accessories.

This desk is a game-changer for anyone serious about their gaming setup.\r\n\r\nFirst off, the build quality is outstanding. The materials used are top-notch, and the desk feels incredibly sturdy. The sleek design adds a modern touch to my gaming room, and the magnetic accessories are a brilliant addition. They keep my workspace organized and clutter-free, which is essential for maintaining focus during intense gaming sessions.\r\n\r\nOne of the standout features is the height-adjustability. Being able to switch between sitting and standing positions effortlessly has made a significant difference in my comfort and overall health. The motorized mechanism works smoothly and quietly, which is a huge plus.\r\n\r\nThe cable management system is another highlight. The integrated tray and magnetic cable anchors have transformed my previously messy desk into a clean and organized setup. No more tangled cables or cluttered workspace ‚Äì it's a dream come true for any gamer who values tidiness.\r\n\r\nOverall, the SecretLab Magnus Pro Gaming Desk has exceeded my expectations in every way. It's a perfect blend of style, functionality, and innovation. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to elevate their gaming experience to the next level. Five stars all the way!

Not tricky to assemble, very well packed etc...\r\nStill no 5 stars because I believe that at this level of price, you could include some more content.\r\nFor example the power plug is only available on one leg, and not on both. So in my case at the end, I still have one cable running along the wall, not even talking about Network cable... Or you keep it as an option to choose but I believe it¬¥s cheaper for you to double the possibilty than to have to handle x2 type of stocked parts!	France

I have two 24‚Äù monitors and one 34‚Äù inch all horizontal and it fits them pretty well. The cable management is obviously great and the sit to stand feature is awesome. Sit to stand is as simple as holding the button down and is great even for taller people. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô1‚Äù and at it‚Äôs tallest it‚Äôs uncomfortably tall for me. At its shortest my knees don‚Äôt fit under the desk with a moderately tall chair. Great product. If you don‚Äôt have the PC holder attached to the desk be careful not to pull the HDMI/display ports on your monitors. Once the PC holder was in I haven‚Äôt had a single issue. WELL worth the money and I‚Äôm never sitting at another desk again.	United States

I wanted in particular a desk with cable storage (this one's awesome) and the ability to hold a pair of headphones and my PC off the ground..(yes I bought the accessory for it). It was all worth it. I use a standing desk at work and this is easily better quality. I shopped amazon for something similar but cheaper... best I could do was save about 2-300$ with questionable quality. This thing does NOT have questionable quality. Packaged like an iPhone with a fancy tool kit... has everything you need and is SUPER sturdy.. made of heavy but high quality steel and the leather mat is a gem. Highly recommend.

I asked if it would be ok to show me and while it was a little wobbly at trhe standing position, I put it down the fact he had it on a very thick fluffy carpet. After pulling the trigger and buying it, I was very happy with the sturdiness on solid wood floors! \r\nQuality seems very good and has put my concerns of cost aside. My only complaint is that the EU store which serves Ireland doesn't come with a UK plug (Ireland uses the UK plug socket) it only ships with the EU plug and included adapter for the price of the desk would have been expected. Otherwise I'm very happy and it looks amazing!	Ireland					https://cdn.stamped.io/tr:h-800:/uploads/photos/63086_6713312903270_5d16d45f_a096_4de7_b2a7_f26ac6f48ea8.jpg?

The packaging exuded a sense of luxury, with every detail meticulously crafted to enhance the anticipation of setting it up. However, I did wonder if more sustainable materials could have been used for padding and protection.Once assembled, the desk's functionality truly shined. The sit-stand feature is a game-changer, allowing me to alternate between sitting and standing throughout the day. Unfortunately, the desk wobbles slightly at its highest setting, which can be a bit annoying.One of my favorite aspects is the magpad; it feels incredibly smooth and adds a sophisticated touch to the workspace. Yet, there's a minor imperfection‚Äîa small kink right by the logo that I can't seem to smooth out.The cable tray is another fantastic feature, effectively clearing the clutter of cables from my desktop. However, the power outlet is on the wrong side for my setup, leaving a tangle of cords by my feet.Overall, the Magnus Desk combines elegance and practicality, with just a few areas that could use improvement.

Very easy to assemble, love the integrated display and the cable management (especially the fact that the main cable goes through the leg instead of having a giant spine in the back).

When looking to buy new desks for my team in a remote location, our Maintenance Director highly recommended this brand because his son had bought one and he thought it was amazing. On his recommendation and after a LOT of research I pulled the trigger and bought 3 of the 59"" versions of the standing desk. Once they came in, we all loved them. When it came time to redo our workspaces after a coworder retired and people moved cubes, we ordered two of the 72"" versions. All of these desks were absolutely worth the money. The accessories they have created help also, but mostly the utility, look and feel, and expected longevity make this desk a better choice than desks at half the cost that will probably only last a handful of years. I expect these deks to last far longer, and compared to a lot of the really solid wooden corporate style desks they are replacing, they are actually more economical."

Basically, I am satisfied with all the items. The desk at maximum height does not seem to be as solid as I expected but it does not fall into pieces. I ordered a desk riser therefore led strip cannot be used at the end of the table bit at the end of the cable tray or I at least could not figure it out how I should have managed that. Soon the heavy duty monitor arm will become available which will improve my room and cable management. In summary I am pretty statisfied with secretlab.

259	https://secretlab.sg/products/magnus-pro?sku=MPB2-15G-STEALTH	Scott F.	5	2024-06-29 00:00:00		I've been hesitant to pull the trigger on a sit-stand desk for a few years now. There was always something that just didn't seem to be thought through, even things as simple as cable management.\r\n\r\nI came across a few YouTube reviews that dug into the MAGNUS Pro XL from unboxing to use and was cautiously optimistic. I ordered the MAGNUS Pro XL, the shelf, the CPU mount, one single and one dual monitor mount, the laptop mount, headphone accessory and a few other accessories and I've been absolutely blown away by the build quality and thought that went into designing this desk.\r\n\r\nThe thing took 30 minutes to assemble and calibrate, looks incredible, is super stable, unnervingly quiet when raising, and incredibly well engineered. Even the accessories are impressive quality, and very well thought out. My previous Veri laptop stand was a solid part and didn't allow proper ventilation for my work laptop. That resulted in the laptop being hot to the touch and discoloration on the stand from exhaust. This laptop stand is incredibly well constructed, doesn't feel cheap, has pads that protect the finish of my laptop, and even has ventilation and a handle designed right into the product. Every single thing I ordered is that well designed, and it was all cheaper than buying an Uplift desk and all the things I'd need to recreate this experience even in part.\r\n\r\nI'm absolutely buying more from Secretlab in the future.\r\n\r\nI only have one real complaint. The desk does not have a drawer or a drawer accessory. I did solve this by installing a drawer myself, but I would LOVE to see one that mounted like the CPU holder does. I'd also love to see more accessories built for the desk, like a magnetic modular arm that can be used for a microphone or webcam.

Also worked with my monitor mounts I already had (I think they fixed a problem with it not working on standard mounts). My only complaint is that the normal, not xl, desk could be a couple inches bigger - from where you are sitting to the back of the desk. Because the wire area it cuts off about 4in of what would be desk space. Makes me want the XL but I dont need a desk that wide.

This is the best purchase I have made. I debated it for months, mainly due to the price, but after long days of sitting and being uncomfortable, I had to do something, and it was the right choice for sure! I researched multiple brands and this seemed to be the best, and I have not been disappointed. I really like how it looks, and everything that comes with it. I also appreciate you can continue to add things, which I will for sure be doing in the future, as I work a lot. Having the ability to sit, stand or move where the desk is in general, has not only helped my back, but I seem to have more energy during the day, which is great! I don't hit that wall at 2:00 that makes me just want to take a nap anymore. After talking to some of my co-workers, I think they will be getting one as well, as it makes that much of a difference in my day-to-day.		https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/465211395/413989582/square.jpg?1682632082	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/465211395/413989582/square.jpg?1682632082

The industrial finish is definitely unique, and I really like the way it looks.  The space of the desktop gives me a ton of flexibility on what I can do with my workspace.  The desk itself fits perfectly in my office space (which doubles as the kid‚Äôs playroom when they‚Äôre home, so being able to have a button to quickly move it to its highest setting is‚Ä¶ convenient, to say the least).

I couldn‚Äôt be happier with my 3-leg L-shaped standing desk‚Äîit‚Äôs truly a game changer for my workspace. The build quality is top-notch; it feels solid and sturdy no matter what height I set it to, even when I‚Äôve got multiple monitors, a laptop, and other gear on top.  The adjustable height is a lifesaver, especially since I alternate between standing and sitting throughout the day. The motor is surprisingly quiet and smooth, which is great because I often switch positions during calls or meetings without any distractions.  What really makes this desk stand out is the spacious L-shape design. It‚Äôs perfect for multitasking‚ÄîI‚Äôve got one side dedicated to work essentials and the other for hobbies and creative projects. It helps me stay organized and inspired.  Assembly was a breeze thanks to the clear instructions. I also love how modern and sleek it looks in my home office; it‚Äôs functional and aesthetic!

Love the ability to semi-customize the color, size, configuration, and accessories. The quality of materials is excellent. The ordering process was super easy and shipping process was quick (arrived earlier than promised). Hard to pick color online and if we had seen colors in person, might have chosen a different one. The only ugliness was putting it together. We used the manual and youtube video simultaneously, but they don't assemble them the same way, which was confusing and frustrating. Being L-shaped definitely seems like it's harder to assemble than a regular desk. However, once assembled, we're super happy with it (we are NOT looking forward to the day we move and have to disassemble and move this desk). The mechanism is super smooth and reasonably quiet. We don't care for the add on drawer (for an L-shaped desk there is no great place to put it that won't get in the way for how it will be used and aesthetically, it doesn't match, but that's nitpicking), but excited to use the hammock. Bottom line: high cost seems like it paid off with a high quality product.

The ergonomic design of this desk is unmatched. It is extremely spacious, fits perfectly in a a corner, raises/lowers to your exact needs, has phenomenal accessory options, and so much more. Even below the desk is designed where you can hide all wires so it does not look or feel like a cluster. The material is as quality as it gets and you can tell every single aspect of this desk was well thought out to meet every need and beyond. This desk has honestly made my home-work experience so much better and I actually look forward to getting work done at this desk because of its comfort and versatility. I can honestly say I have been more productive since getting this desk with my online/computer work. I HIGHLY recommend this desk with zero hesitation whatsoever!		https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/661272654/644016196/square.jpg?1734572691	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/661272654/644016210/square.jpg?1734572697	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/661272654/644016220/square.jpg?1734572703	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/661272654/644016239/square.jpg?1734572709						https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/661272654/644016239/square.jpg?1734572709	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/661272654/644016246/square.jpg?1734572715	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/661272654/644016255/square.jpg?1734572723	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/661272654/644016267/square.jpg?1734572729	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/661272654/644016196/square.jpg?1734572691	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/661272654/644016210/square.jpg?1734572697	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/661272654/644016220/square.jpg?1734572703	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/661272654/644016239/square.jpg?1734572709	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/661272654/644016246/square.jpg?1734572715	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/661272654/644016255/square.jpg?1734572723	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/661272654/644016267/square.jpg?1734572729

The L-shape provides significantly more room, and allows me to also more comfortably use my wacom cintiq 27 pro, without having to rearrange my entire desk every single time.  The motor mechanism is also significantly more quiet and sturdy then my previous standing desk, and also doesnt throw random errors every time I have it go up or down. I didnt even realize how much that was annoying me until I had a new desk that wasnt doing that.  The desk itself is a great quality, and I do definitely recommend it, but there were a few issues.   I dont know if it was Uplift not loading it to Fedex or if it was Fedex themseleves, but the small desk portition that makes up the short side of the L didnt show up initially with the other 5 packages for the desk. I contacted Uplift after Fedex failed to deliver it and they were able to send one over for no extra charge.  Other then that, that instructions for putting this together arent super specific when it comes to building the desk with a right side return, the instructions are written assuming you would want a left side return.   I would say 90% of it pretty straight forward when building a right side return. But there is no indication within the instructions or on the desk portion itself to tell you which direction to face the return side desk when trying to attach the hardware to it. Visually both directions look identical, but they do have slightly different placements. So if you choose the wrong direction, and the attachment of the return side to the main desk isnt lining up, you will need to disassemble it and put it back together. This tripped me up for quite a while when I was initially putting it all together.  The only other thing, and this is just an incredibly insignificant nitpick and could very easily be remedied by me going to the store, but there isnt any screws or other hardware included to mount the powerstrip that comes with the the advanced cable management package. I didnt have any additional screws on hand that I could have used, so I just put it inside the cable management tray that comes with that package. Again, incredibly insignificant, I could totally have fixed it myself, but it wasnt a big enough deal for me at the time of wiring everything up to actually stop doing what I was doing to head to the store.

It took around 1.5 hours to assemble with 2 people but this was also the L shaped larger desk so I would imagine the standard standing desk would be much quicker. Workspace is large and the rubberwood desktop is very nice, even with everything on my desk for both work and personal I have plenty of room to work with. The desk is very smooth when adjusting and has a very large range of height adjustment. The only downside I have was the extra cable management I bought was meh at best, the surge protector is nice and has a very long cord but the cable channels just aren't enough to fit what I had so I had to buy a different solution.

It goes quite low, which is what I wanted so I didn't need to get a keyboard tray. It goes higher than I need too (I'm 5' 10""). The motor is very quiet. The desk is super stable with zero wobble. The installation was very well documented and packaged so I was never confused. All and all it's been superb. The only complaint I could mention is I didn't realize all my finger/hand prints would show up so much on the black desk... it drives me a little batty, haha."

Instructions for assembly weren't great, we had to read everything backwards since I had the wild idea to get a return on the other side from default.  Desk seems solid though. Maybe ask for a review a year from now and not right after I've damaged apartment hallways moving it, am still sore from assembling it, and I've had a chance to see if it will last as long as advertised. Barely had it a week, that's not an appropriate time to review a product like this!

I am very happy with the quality of the desk - the materials are heavy and solid, everything fit together nicely. Having the option for many different accessories is what helped Uplift stand out from the other desks I was considering.   The instructions that were written and the instructions on the YouTube video are different in some ways, so it was difficult to put together this desk for the first time. Now that I've done it I would feel more comfortable doing it again if necessary, but I'm glad I don't have to. Those are the reasons that this is 4 stars instead of 5, but overall I'm happy with the purchase.   The hue of the two pieces of my desk are different because I opted for the rubberwood surface. When I contacted customer service they did offer to return and re-send a new desktop, but after the issues I had putting the desk together I decided to live with it.		https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/555868426/535651910/square.jpg?1710343254	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/555868426/535651864/square.jpg?1710343250	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/555868426/535651947/square.jpg?1710343257	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/555868426/535651910/square.jpg?1710343254						https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/555868426/535651864/square.jpg?1710343250	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/555868426/535651947/square.jpg?1710343257

I‚Äôve had a random no name desk for years and finally decided to get a new desk. I looked around looking at other people‚Äôs desk setups and saw standing desks and how minimalistic and ergonomic they are. So I looked up standing desks and came across uplift desk. Letting me completely customize the new desk I was going to get. After looking on their site I wanted a wood countertop. Walnut wood to be exact. So I bought a 60x60 L shape walnut desk. I just put it together and was sadly disappointed when I realized it was laminate and not wood. My mistake of not seeing the small laminate section underneath. I‚Äôm also torn if I like or dislike a L desk being my first L shape. Definitely would recommend the company based off of quality and support for their product. Just wished I paid more attention to detail when ordering.

I absolutely love my desk. Part of it came broken though which is why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5.   It wasn't worth it to send it back because we had to close the office to assemble it. I just gorilla glued the piece of wood from the desk that was hanging off. Part of the wood was sliced off and came like that.   I love the uplift part of the desk though. I am so much more productive when standing!

The gentleman acted as a consultant, and not a sales person. He offered a custom top to meet my desires, and wasn‚Äôt trying to rip me off in the process. The hardware associated with the desk is of excellent quality, or at least all excepting some of the ‚Äúfree‚Äù accessories. The only reason for not a full five stars that the surface of the desk arrived with some very noticeable imperfections; not variations in the wood, but light scratches in several places. It wasn‚Äôt from shipping because the packaging wasn‚Äôt damaged; it seems that probably this is just a ‚Äúpretty good‚Äù level quality is acceptable when it comes to the perfect surface finish. The surface finish has already chipped in one place and I‚Äôm an extremely careful individual, so it seems the surface finish is not incredibly durable. Again decent, just not amazing. Overall, I definitely recommend as the four star review would suggest.

It‚Äôs amazing. Solid, good looking, mechanically sound, and the little additional upgrades and add-ons make my desk feel unique and ME! There is only 1 reason that this doesn‚Äôt get a perfect review, and honestly, I wanted to give it less stars because of this - the instructions and building process. I‚Äôm not an engineer or handy man by any means but I am also not an idiot. I always welcome a challenge and like to do work myself - I‚Äôve built MANY ikea things over the years. But nothing has ever come within a mile of how overly complicated this building process was. The desk I got was L shaped, and I wanted the main desk on the left and return on the right. Well - the instructions only show how to build with the main on the right and return on the left. So I basically had to navigate the entire instructions backwards - and to Make it worse, every now and then they show you what it looks like with the return on the right, like my setup. But then they go right back to the next step in the default position. I would have rather they just show one way of building it the entire time so I know to do the exact opposite build of it - instead it‚Äôs just a mixed, jumbled headache if instructions. REALLY unpleasant experience. Please add instructions for both sides, it would have saved me hours.

The directions were very clear and all parts were very properly packaged and identified. The desk looks great, the operation is smooth, and the motors are very quiet. The black bamboo top looks great and the structure is very solid. Close tolerances make for a very tight and strong assembly. I am very happy overall. I did have minor damage to the top due to Fed Ex Shipping and Up Lift was very supportive with options for resolution. Also, a coupon was issued for $150 in October that they retroactively applied it to my order. Team Uplift, especially Danielle, has been great and I would order from them again without hesitation.		https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/512331874/476667328/square.jpg?1697230227	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/512331874/476667328/square.jpg?1697230227

My white on white L-shaped desk fits perfectly into my corner home office, and the lifting mechanism is amazing. It's quiet, quick and super robust.   All of the cables are completely hidden and every guests that visits our house compliments the desk. Super happy with my choice.  To be honest, I spent MUCH more time assembling the desk on my own that is shown in the video, but I might just be not the sharpest tool in the box.		https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/479764610/437034899/square.jpg?1687800134	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/479764610/437034905/square.jpg?1687800137	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/479764610/437034899/square.jpg?1687800134	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/479764610/437034905/square.jpg?1687800137

"As a product, the standing desk is great. Where it lacks is in its assembly instructions. The written instructions seem to be written in an overly cautious way... by that I mean it seems to have several unnecessary steps. This issue is compounded by the fact that the hardware has changed since the assembly videos were produced, so they're very unhelpful. Also, some of the hardware isn't compatible with the instructions... maybe it's just me, but all but 2 of my central support rails didn't have the center markings that the instructions insist you ""line up"" before tightening the fasteners. Also, I think more emphasis needs to be put on the actual work of assembling the desk; buyers should be told up front, before purchase, that the assembly instructions are geared toward the work being done with two people."

It fits in my office perfectly and being able to move my desk is a gamechanger. What‚Äôs especially nice is if I ever decide I need to change anything or upgrade a part of my desk, UPLIFT has made it so easy to do so. On top of everything there is a 15 year warranty built in that should cover any potential wear and tear I could foresee.

It's super stable and smoothly raises and lowers so I can stand, sit with the desk high for watchmaking, and sit with the desk low for my daily job. It was a lengthy task putting it together, but the instructions were clear and everything came well-packed. My only small qualm is that the two dark bamboo pieces were slightly different shades of brown; I'd appreciate if they color-matches the pieces a bit better. But otherwise I can't have enough good things to say about this product.

I found my uplift standing desk to be easy to assemble, high quality and it is a great value. It adjusts nicely to my preferences, operates quietly and I love the Acacia Chevron finish.   Assembly was simple and took less time than it took to disassemble my old glass L-shaped desk. I assembled it and had a conference call the same evening.  I'd done my research but was a little concerned I'd be underwhelmed by the quality, but I'm greatly impressed, I can't stop admiring the desktop.   This desk definitely gives me more space than my old L-shaped desk and has created a more ergonomic environment for me.

There's a reason, which boils down to peace. Yeah, that's right, peace. That peace you get when you don't have to think about making another decision because you know it's already right. That's the kind I'm talking about. These desks are perfect. They're built like tanks and the pricepoint is about right. Oh, and they get delivered lightning fast.

It is very stable, even raised. I have the desk set to a standing height of 45"" and notice no wobble with every day use. This was my biggest concern when looking for a sit/stand desk. Leaning on it, typing, or adjusting monitors does not cause any wobble in any direction. You can make it wobble if you bump in to it a lot or try hard, but I would say that does not constitute normal, every day use. At least not for me. This is super easy to put together, though you'll probably want a second person to help turn it over. Be careful if ordering 3rd party C-clamp monitor stands (not through Uplift) as the desk frame may be in the way of the clamp. I was able to get mine to work by clamping on to the desk and frame."

I got the 1.5"" saman 80"" long butcher block and it's gorgeous. Because the desk is so sturdy I can push it into place myself and hardly anything on my desk moves while doing it. I would warn others though that the 4 legged commercial desk has cross-beams that can get in the way sometimes. For example, you have to leave the last crossbar off if you want anything to clamp to the back of the desk. And, if the desk is very low, you'll feel another crossbar on your thighs towards the front of the desk if you're sitting. For this reason, I'd recommend the 2-legged version unless you absolutely need the 4 legs. I have this monster in my office and I found that I don't need the 4 legged version like I thought I did. Seeing the build quality in person, I'm sure 2 legs would have been just fine for all my needs."		https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/540001395/515559864/square.jpg?1706352777	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/540001395/515559870/square.jpg?1706352780	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/540001395/515559864/square.jpg?1706352777	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/540001395/515559870/square.jpg?1706352780

I'm glad I decided to go with that because this thing is STURDY. Not a shake or wobble even when leaning on it. Quite impressive. I've built and used the two leg versions in our office and liked those but the upgrade is worth it in my opinion. The quality of the packing, legs, and laminate top is excellent. Looks very premium and was worth every penny! Also, insanely fast shipping.

Very satisfied with the quality of the desk. Looks like UPLIFT has considered every details. The delivery was fast and well protected. Overall, great product. One thing could be better was that the free gifts, like the organizer etc, could be better. After all, the desk cost me a fortune. Otherwise, very recommended to anyone looking for good quality desk which is gonna last for many years.

The items were helpfully left on the porch. The previous Uplift bamboo desk that I ordered in 2022 was left propped at the corner of the closed garage door, where it would not be noticed until the garage door was opened, whereupon I could have backed into it.   The June 30 desktop had a two-inch gash in the package, so I was concerned about it because the bamboo was visible through the hole. Thankfully, the gash turned out to be on the underside. Moreover, the excellent packaging did its job; there was not even a scratch.  Assembling the second Uplift desk was much easier than the first one, which I first had to haul upstairs. Although assembly this time took several hours, there was no problem because the desk is precisely engineered. I got the four-leg V2 standing desk model (two legs at both ends). Two leg connectors were also included. This means that the two legs at each end are joined together. This design is more secure than having four separate legs.  I disagree that two individuals are needed to flip the assembled desk. Even with two able-bodied persons, that method requires some heavy lifting and no room for a slip by one of the lifters. I assembled it on top of a dining table covered with a moving blanket. When completed, I simply pulled the assembled desk to one end of the table, gently slid the bottom end of the desk onto a moving blanket on the tile floor, stood the desk up vertically on one end, swiveled it around 360 degrees, leaned it back on the table with one end of the desk (two legs) resting on the blanketed table end, and then easily swiveled the table end of the desk onto cushioned mats on the floor. Unlike the recommended two-guy method, there was no lifting at all, and it was very easy.  Although the top of the grommet-free desktop is not blemished or scratched, I was disappointed to see, after standing the desk upright, that it has a dull and plain bamboo surface instead of a beautifully glazed, glassy-smooth surface like my first Uplift bamboo desk. If the first desktop was graded A+, this one rates only a B as a result of the skipped finishing process. As for the small bamboo table, it makes a great matching TV table.

Working nicely. A lot of accessories. Beautiful solid wood table top color and finish. Probably the best option for a standing desk on the market.  Cons: the desktop will likely have some damage. I ordered two desks, with different tabletops, both arrived with a defect. In the first case, Uplift was gracious to send another table top. In the second case, the damage was hard to spot and was only found by assemblymen. At that point, I just decided to keep it.  Also, it takes a LOT of time to assemble. Don't believeIn my case it was two people for three hours. You get many many boxes with instructions. Count in that cost of assembly, and don't count on TaskRabbit.

I needed something that was going to be solid and reliable working full time from home. I decided to try out the Uplift desk after seeing positive feedback on their products and I have to say I am absolutely thrilled with my decision. It was completely worth every penny, and I could not be happier! The desk is beautiful, and the directions were easy to follow when putting it together. I love the cable organizer kit that comes with it, I feel like my office is truly my optimal workspace now.

The legs themselves are incredibly sturdy and go higher than I imagine anyone ever needing yet still don't wobble. I have the desk on the on the heavy casters so I can move it around but honestly they're probably overkill.   I'm hanging my full size PC tower from underneath the desk as well so it all moves with the desk.

A worthwhile investment.	"OVERVIEW: I purchased the Uplift 4 leg standing desk V2, with industrial finish, 80"" black laminate top, flush advance controls, and matching 2 drawer filing cabinet with seat for minimalist storage and the occasional visitor. I wanted something that was stable at any height, would last, look classy and stand up to the use of a home office and occasional maker. I'm a diligent engineer that likes to research all available options, rest, and revisit, before confidently settling on the best one. Hence I looked at way too many customer reviews, YouTube videos, and forum/article comparisons before determining this fit the bill perfectly. SIZE: I was worried about 80"" being a little to big (even with my single 38"" dell ultrawide) but would say if you have the room go for it. It doesn't look out of place when clean and leaves room for playing with Lego, spreading out the paper, projects, snacks, or whatever suits your heart's content. 72"" would work great too, but think most would regret 60"" unless you want a smaller desk. AESTHETICS: It looks great next to the piano; grey/black laptops, mice, chairs, monitors, and cables disappear; and I'm sure this combo will hide wear well. Definitely recommend the solid matching cabinet if you want to accentuate your chosen finish. (Note the extra drawer wheel to eliminate tipping.) FUNCTION: I'm a little over 6'1"". This desk has more than enough height, is stable at the very top, and I love the convenient but unobtrusive flat control panel. No need for drawers, especially if you have the filing cabinet. I was hesitant not getting the commercial version at this size but the 4 leg setup with upper angles and lower connected feet is plenty stable. There is no monitor wobble (though I'm not on an arm), no bar in the way of long legs (that would accumulate shoe scuffs), and it will look great in the middle of a room as a table or desk if needed in future setups. The 15yr warranty, no coaster/fuss/maintenance laminate top, and solid brand add confidence that I'll get my bang for the buck for years to come. WARNING: These tops are hard to ship. The first top came well packaged but with a bubble at the edge that exposed the core (Uplift mistake). After a quick 10min call (including the online claim with pics) they had a new one on it's way to me. Second top was beat-up by shipping (FedEx issue). They had torn the ends off, lost half the packaging, and dragged it on those same ends to set it against the garage. Repeated the process. Uplift offered a chair if I just wanted to keep the old top and call it done or another try at making it right. I figured if I'll have this for 15years, let's be happy with it‚Ä¶ though that standing chair was tempting. Third top arrived in perfect condition. SUMMARY: Good company, great service, solid product. Only troubles might be settling on your dream setup or being patient with shipping struggles. A few months out, and I'm very happy with this purchase."		https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/477614381/434602212/square.jpg?1687042868	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/477614381/434602221/square.jpg?1687042871	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/477614381/434602212/square.jpg?1687042868	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/477614381/434602221/square.jpg?1687042871

Sad I didn't get it earlier	"I suffered through using a ""Varidesk"" standing desk adapter for years. I'm not very happy that I've switched to the 4-leg Uplift. I'm easily annoyed by a monitor that wobbles when I type and this thing is absolutely rock solid. If you work from home, you should invest in your workspace so that it meets your ergonomic needs."

Amazingly quick turnaround.  I was very happy with the desk frame, but not with the appearance of the top. Thought wide plank meant actual wide planks, but it's more like high quality butcher block vs cheaper butcher block. Thankfully, the return process was super easy and quick so I'm counting it as another plus for Uplift.		https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/584281912/567043334/square.jpg?1716505648	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/584281912/567043334/square.jpg?1716505648

The desk is by far the most expensive office purchase I have ever made (the 80‚Äù pheasantwood with quad leg setup). I had a weird issue with the legs reporting overheating anytime I raised the desk to max height, regardless of where I started. UPLIFT went through weeks of trial and error to get this issue figured out and resolved. Even when I didn‚Äôt like the solution,they worked with me without hesitation. I went through them because of their warranty, if the customer service remains the same in 10 years as it did after two weeks from the purchase date, I will not recommend anyone but UPLIFT for a quality desk purchase. So far, fantastic!

Every screw lined up with amazing accuracy considering all that could get sightly off. Anyone self assembling the 4-leg version should realize two people are really necessary to bring this thing upright because it's just very solid (especially with butcher block top). I also would suspect that the 2-leg version should handle most use cases here easily. This is just speculation though from seeing the 4-leg version. If there is one area that could be improved on it would be the ergonomics of assembly. Assembly could be made a tad easier without sacrificing on the overall quality of the standup desk.

"I went with the V2 with the 70x30"" 1.5"" birch top and grey frame.   So far, after using it for the past month, I'm pretty happy with the setup overall. There is no movement at all with the desk or my dual Studio Displays when I'm doing the day-to-day things like typing, moving my mouse, etc, while at sitting height or standing height (I'm 5'10""). If I have it at the max height possible, there is some minor movement but it stops quickly. It's nothing like previous desks I've had at that would shake considerably when at their max height.   Setting up the desk was fairly straight forward. Took me about 1hr overall to get the desk itself assembled by myself. The wire management and other items I mounted to the bottom of my desk took a few days, mostly because of work and waiting for various parts to arrive from certain retailers. Programming the sitting/standing heights and min/max heights was easy and well explained in the instructions.   The only complaints I have about the overall setup process are:   - Motor cables: It came with (2) short cables, and (2) long cables. Both of which were way longer than they needed to be, which made wire management for them more complicated than it needed to be. I understand they probably want to stock lengths that will work with multiple SKU's, like their L-shaped desks, but it would be nice if they optimized the lengths a little better so there isn't so much remaining length to deal with.  - Wire management for the motor cables: Aside from dealing with the extra length, the other part I wish they would change is the path to the control box they plug into. It would be perfect if they had some slots/holes cut into the crossbar ends/crossbar rails, so the motor cables could pass through them, instead of having to go over the ends/bars.  - Missing parts:: After all of the desk parts were delivered from Uplift, I took inventory of everything to make sure I got everything I ordered. Everything I ordered was delivered, but I did notice some minor parts that were missing and are mentioned in the components page and later on in the instructions. The components page lists (4) Small Hole Plug and (4) Large Hole Plug, which covers the holes in the front and back of the upper frame. The instructions do mention they are optional. I did reach out to their CS and the rep said their warranty team told her ""these plugs are not shipped with the frame that you selected"" and ""This is a glitch in our instructions"". I asked if I could purchase them, since the rear of my desk isn't up against a wall and the holes are visible. She responded that they are not available at this time for sale or shipment, and that they do plan on having it set up eventually and to check back in a few months.   As for the desk itself, everything is great so far. The desk top itself has held up well to various items with somewhat sharp edges being laid on top of it. The thickness also made it easy to mount items like external hard drives, Mac Studio mount, and UPS mount. Controls are easy to use, and it moves up/down fairly quickly and with no issues. The motors aren't very loud, but I wouldn't say they're super quiet by any means, about on par with other standing desks I've had.   The only complaint I have about the desk itself is the lack of under mounted drawer options from Uplift for their 4-leg desks. I had reached out to their CS prior to ordering my desk in regards to their under mounted drawers, and whether any could work with their 4-leg desk. The CS rep mentioned their Locking Under Desk Drawer with Shelf, but the brackets would need to modified by the end-user in order to fit around the front crossbar on the 4-leg desk. I understand the front crossbar on the 4-leg desks limits what you can mount, but it would be nice if Uplift offered a version of their Locking Under Desk Drawer with Shelf that had brackets that accommodated the front crossbar. After not finding any aftermarket options that I liked, I ended up ordering their Narrow 2-Drawer File Cabinet to hold items I normally would keep in a desk drawer.   With all of that taken into consideration, I would buy 100% it all again."

I wanted to use this with a walking treadmill below the desk, and really didn't want my monitor to wobble from the floor vibrations. This desk is fantastic, very solid. I would guess that the non-commercial version would've been similarly stable. I am glad I ordered the birch top, which had metal inserts pre-fitted to mount the frame to. Whoever did the packaging for shipment did a fantastic job. I wish I would've gotten the wider version of the desk. One thing to note is that because the desk moves up and down, you'll want to put more things on your desktop instead of the floor, ex. subwoofer, pc tower, etc, to avoid short cable lengths.

I purchased the uplift 4 legged commercial standing desk with 72 inch walnut laminate top and this desk transformed my work from home setup!   First, We have owned several standing desks including a two legged desk from autonomous and a 3 legged L desk from Kaidi/ varidesk and this uplift desk is by far the most sturdy and well built! Uplift goes above and beyond in quality and construction compared to other standing desks we‚Äôve used. This includes having a 1‚Äù thick table top vs the standard .75‚Äù, offering a 4 legged version compared to 2 legged versions, quality of the soft touch control panel vs plastic buttons all make this thing stand out.   I was a little worried about stability on the 4 legged desk at first looking at older reviews saying the desk can be a little wobbly at maximum height based on the previous design which didn‚Äôt have the bottom cross bar. this is definitely not a concern anymore with their newer design.   Desk assembly was straightforward and fast and you don‚Äôt need a second person for assembly until it‚Äôs time to flip the desk over, then you will definitely want some help if you have the 4 legged version.   The accessories that come with it are a nice addition. My favorite is the rocker board while my 8 year old son like to read books in the hammock.   Lastly, the ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù that this desk/company offers including a 500+ pound weight limit, 15 year warranty, incredible customer service, and more put this desk over the top for me and I can‚Äôt recommend this desk enough if you are in the market for a standing desk! Get the 4 legged version, you won‚Äôt regret it!		https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/486335529/447861273/square.jpg?1690407265	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/486335529/447861296/square.jpg?1690407269	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/486335529/447861332/square.jpg?1690407277	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/486335529/447861250/square.jpg?1690407261						https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/486335529/447861250/square.jpg?1690407261	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/486335529/447861351/square.jpg?1690407281	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/486335529/447861199/square.jpg?1690407253	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/486335529/447861226/square.jpg?1690407257	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/486335529/447861322/square.jpg?1690407273	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/486335529/447861273/square.jpg?1690407265	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/486335529/447861296/square.jpg?1690407269	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/486335529/447861332/square.jpg?1690407277	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/486335529/447861250/square.jpg?1690407261	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/486335529/447861351/square.jpg?1690407281	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/486335529/447861199/square.jpg?1690407253	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/486335529/447861226/square.jpg?1690407257	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/486335529/447861322/square.jpg?1690407273

It is no wonder why you will not find these in stores. There isn‚Äôt any other standing desk on the market that compares to the quality of UPLIFT Desks. They are easy to assemble and operate. This desk has helped myself stay more active and productive in a sedentary position within my company. I love this desk so much I am going to purchase one for my home office and customize it with one of the butcher block or solid wood options for a top. My only problem is trying to figure out which one of the beautiful options to go with. Do not let the cost be a factor. The quality of product you are buying could easily have a higher price tag.

"I recently purchased an Uplift standing desk and it has been a game-changer for my workspace. As someone who is 6'6"", finding a desk that accommodates my height and helps with my posture has always been a challenge. This desk meets all my needs and more.  First and foremost, the height adjustability of the Uplift desk is exceptional. It easily adjusts to a standing position that is comfortable for my height, allowing me to stand on my feet most of the time. This has significantly improved my posture and reduced the discomfort I used to feel from sitting for long periods.  The build quality of the desk is outstanding. The wood finish adds a touch of elegance to my workspace, and the desk itself is incredibly sturdy. I never have to worry about it wobbling or feeling unstable, even when I have multiple monitors and other equipment on it.  A person from TaskRabbit assembled the desk for me, and they did a fantastic job. They were very personable and professional, ensuring that everything was put together perfectly. This made the whole experience even better, as I didn't have to worry about the assembly process.  Overall, I couldn't be happier with my Uplift standing desk. It's the perfect solution for tall individuals like myself who need a reliable and aesthetically pleasing desk to improve their work environment. I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a standing desk!"

With that in mind, we were on the lookout for a quality desk that is extra stable. This 4-leg desk with the horizontal bar option seemed like our best bet. Now that it's been in our office for several weeks, I can say that the construction is extremely solid. The up/down motion is smooth, with no abrupt jerks. Overall, it's as steady as it gets.

I have a 2 monitor setup with one of them being a heavy monitor (23lb) and I was concerned about stability so I did a lot of research. The desk is well made and very stable. I got the big casters which makes it easy to move around in my office, this obviously affects a bit the stability (forward/backward) but not too much to be honest and unless i purposely try to rock it my monitors do not wobble. I go between different positions every day and have not had any issues. My only criticism on the 4 leg one is that it has less accessories due to the stabilization bars being on the way of some of the drawers, etc... so keep that in mind (In order to install the arm I had to remove 1 as instructed by UPLIFTDESK but there are still 3 more bars and I don't feel it affected). That is OK by me because I prioritized a rugged and stable table rather than adding drawers, etc but I wish they clearly mention that. All in all I would recommend again due to the quality, warranty and how it works.

So far I love my UPLIFT desk. Looks great in my home office. I went with the 1.5‚Äù butcherblock 60‚Äù wide with grey frame/legs. It shipped quickly and on time. Customer service did a great job answering some pre-sale questions I had. Assembly was relatively easy; instructions were clear and easy to follow. The desk operates smoothly going from sitting to standing position, etc. I went with four legs as opposed to two for added stability. My desk is on carpeting, and I also wanted it on casters so I could move it. The desk is super stable even in standing height. Have little kids so the keypad with a lock feature was also a great value add. The only tiny negative I would mention is the cable tie mounts (for under desk cable management) the come free with the desk are pretty much unusable. They are tiny and not big enough to wrap even the power cables for the legs. A quick trip to the hardware store took care of it so not a big deal. I‚Äôve only had the desk for a few weeks so cant speak to long term reliability, durability but so far this desk is awesome and super solid. Very happy with the purchase.

"I worked from a folding table for almost a year, so my excitement may be a bit biased, but I've also built custom floating desks in the past. being my first standing desk, its amazing to change up my posture through the day to give my legs a chance to stretch as a developer. the desk is massive (80""x30"") and Heavier than I had imagined, but solid as all heck. At full height there is a little shake in the monitors but only if you're really getting pushing on it. It's otherwise completely unnoticeable. Would recommend getting your monitors higher off the desk surface using a monitor arm, raised monitor shelf, or some other method to separate your arms from your monitors. NOTICE: Assemble this desk in or nearby the place you intend to keep it. Moving it is no easy task due to is heft. Motors are fairly quiet, noticeable but not obnoxious in any way. raising and lower is reasonably quick and smooth. Lack of built in cable management requires you to be pretty creative to keep items where you want them. but does give you enough room to do almost anything you want on the underside. A bit of feedback to uplift... all you need to do is add a hinged metal raceway on the back horizontal support in the shape of a c-channel with a couple of draw latches. if you really wanna step up your game, add some T-slots or thru slots for adjustable mounting. Yes, I know I could just buy some at Home Depot but after spending close to 2 grand, creature comforts stand out. Against the others."

Zero bounce on my monitor when I type. Side note, the thing weighs like 300 pounds so I know it will hold up to years of use.  I replaced an inferior brand 2 leg model and my monitor used to shake with every keystroke. I had to mount my monitor arm to the wall which was bad for moving up and down.

I chose the 80"" black bamboo option. On their website and in videos they talk about how rock solid it is. They aren't exaggerating. Fully extended it's amazingly solid. Take their advice and get a friend to help you lift it up once it's assembled because it is heavy. I think the fact that it has so much weight adds to its stability. I'm extremely happy with my new desk. It's very high quality. Now the fun part of organizing begins. Cheers"

The quality of the product is top-notch. In large part, the service is also excellent. The reason that I won't give five stars is that the directions that came with the desk were poor and when I called for support, I didn't receive it. Apparently, the issue is that the directions were for a left-side return and I had a right-hand side return. Once I stopped paying attention to the directions, everything worked out, but it took twice as long to put together as it should have and caused a significant amount of frustration.

Issues with my neck/shoulder are alleviated! I love that I now have an entire desk to use. I purchased the cord minder, the under desk drawer and one file cabinet ... all work great in conjunction with the desk. Hubby asked why I didn't get a cheaper one on Amazon: Varidesk is the leader as far as I'm concerned. I loved the desktop version and love this one even more. Those on Amazon had lots of motor issues: Varidesk stands behind their product. Yes a bit more but I got it on sale and honestly, the cost was irrelevant. Needed to fix the health issues and this new desk works wonders. Thank you Varidesk for making such a wonderful product!! I would - and do - recommend this desk for anyone: hubby looking to get one for his guitar studio and I think that would be marlevous!	üá∫üá∏ United States

He didn't have any negative feedback regarding missing pieces or misaligned holes...or anything of that nature. I ordered the large desk; everything fits on it well. It is sturdy, & the vertical movement is quiet, smooth, and...professional. I spilled a few drops of Chai Tea Latte on it, and it wiped up with no worries. The only thing I wish it had...and I shopped through many desks & still chose this one...is a drawer. I like having my little nic-nacs handy, but not necessarily seen. I would like them available at every height that the desk is at the moment when I need them (as opposed to having to go to my file cabinet drawer). Other than that, it was a great purchase. Foot note: I ordered the Vari monitor stand, for a monitor & laptop. I will be returning it because I decided to put up 2 monitors & keep the laptop on the desk, because there is plenty of room to do so!	üá∫üá∏ United States

My desktop converter was always a much better quality than the ones I saw others at work using, and I've had good experience with their customer support in the past, so sticking with Vari wasn't a hard decision.\n\nWhile both are great products, the standing desk is a great improvement. It's incredibly sturdy (even more so than the previous non-Vari stationary desk I was using), and very simple to raise and lower. I love that you're able to create height presets and how customizable they are. I was expecting it to raise at specific increments, but just tapping the button lets me raise and lower it with very small adjustments to find the perfect height. It even came with surprise desk hooks in the box which I wasn't sure I'd use, but turns out I kind of love.	üá∫üá∏ United States

The customer service representative asked if I could just ¬´ tape the panel to the desk ¬ª. Really?

I was a little hesitant to spend this much on a desk, but it has been worth every penny. It is very heavy duty and does not wobble at all. I think this size is perfect - I have used a multiple monitor setup and am now using a 43"" TV as a computer monitor with plenty of room to spare. The desk operates smoothly and is easy to transition to different heights with the memory settings. I recently came back from a two week vacation and found that the desk was no longer functioning. I called customer service figuring I would have to buy a replacement part. They were able to walk me through some troubleshooting steps and found that the left motor was no longer working likely due to a power surge that happened when I was out of town. I was really surprised to find the desk was still under warranty five years later. Since I owned the 1st generation of the product which is no longer made, I was offered a new 2nd generation desk at no charge as a replacement. Wow! I was not expecting that and am so happy to be getting a new desk even after all these years of owning the product. I even get to keep the old one which can still be used as a static desk. Not very often to see that kind of customer service these days. So while this is a premium product I would say it is worth paying the price for a quality item and a good company that stands by their products."	üá∫üá∏ United States

It's VERY heavy as you might expect but if you have a helper, it makes it even easier. My wife loves it and the quality seems very high.\n\nThe reason for my one star deduction is the fact that the undermount desk drawer is constantly out of stock. When I wanted to order it, it was listed for $75. Now it's been out of stock for almost a month and my questions to support about me getting the drawer for $75 instead of the now listed price of $95, it was crickets. So now, not only have a waited a month for the drawer to come back in stock but now have to apparently pay $20 for a drawer because Vari can't figure out their supply chain issues. I also bought a $350 chair which is amazing, so again why they can't honor the original price cut after spending over 1K is beyond me.\n\n\n\nAnyways, the desk and chair are superb :-) Pics attached	üá∫üá∏ United States					https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/673519294/656446368/original.jpg?1737995194	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/673519294/656446394/original.jpg?1737995198

They immediately shipped me a new ""brain"" for the desk. The ""brain' arrived in 3 days and I installed it. The desk still would not power up. I again contacted Vari and they determined that it was either the control pad or the power cord. They decided to send me an entire ""box 2"" which contains a set of power legs, a brain box, a power cord and a touch pad. The box arrived in 3 days. I installed the new control pad and the desk powered up and worked flawlessly. Vari advised me I could keep the extra parts as spares, which is fine with me.

I am very picky about what I want and I wanted something with an executive look that would have good wire management.\nI am so thrilled that I waited to find this desk.  The only thing I wish was that it had a 30"" depth for the desktop.  Otherwise, it is a fantastic piece of furniture and looks amazing in my office!"

One comment: the courtesy blind/cover seems to be shorter then the one shown in picture. I&#039;m 5' 7&#039; and when standing, the courtesy blind ends up not covering the front entirely. Would be great if the blind was a bit longer.

It‚Äôs way cheaper and the shipping is free unless you get ‚Äúwhite glove‚Äù shipping. It‚Äôs measurements are exact but empty space will make it look bigger than what it is so if you‚Äôre looking for something even more bigger, I would recommend the Ford one. Very heavy! 550 lbs. You will need help moving and assembling if you plan on doing on your own. I got the white glove delivery and it was absolutely over and beyond the best service ever! They ship product to delivery company who then calls to schedule delivery time. They install, setup, center, wipe down, and genuinely want to hear what you think! They waited for me to look over it and made suggestions as to pieces that would go so well with it! I was so impressed! 		https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/558777274/538763354/square.png?1711127774	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/558777274/538763354/square.png?1711127774

This is the most luxurious desk I have ever seen and it's worth every single penny! The delivery was stellar! I received both chair and desk with absolutely no scratch. I was so worried about ordering such a huge item online. My concern was that the item might arrive damaged. It was so not the case. The delivery team was professional and handled the table with extreme care. Set up wasn't difficult at all as it required very few parts to connect together. That is, the draws were fully assembled. It was a matter of connecting parts together. I can go on and on regarding the beauty of this desk. It's real wood with a very nice and smooth finish.

Most of the sites had the same desks, boring. Then I came across Zuri's desks. They were beautiful. creative, stylish, and works of art. I decided to call a design consultant at Zuri. This is when my world changed. The designer answered all of my questions and told me she would be by my side until I was fully pleased with my purchase. With that support, I ordered the Ford Desk with Left Return and the Hayes Cabinet. I did at the White Glove Delivery which is well worth it. They assembled all of the furniture in my home. Several weeks later I received a call from a transport company and they were ready to deliver. That day came and the two gentlemen were very courteous and took special care to put all the furniture together without any damage. They explained everything to me about the keys and the file drawers and took all of the packing materials and boxes with them. The process was seamless from ordering to delivery. 		https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/605331897/591136830/square.png?1722357202	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/605331897/591136830/square.png?1722357202

I've been looking for a quality desk for several weeks and couldn't find anything modern with high-end features/appearance. Then I came across Zuri and saw the Ford Executive Desk. It was exactly what I was looking for. I know it was a bit expensive, but I received a Holiday discount. Plus, you have to pay for quality, so no complaints here. The product arrived within a week and was packaged extremely well (about 7 boxes). I wish the box containing the assembly instructions was marked, so I didn't have to open every box to find it... but oh well. Instructions were easy to follow and took about 4-6 hrs to assemble once unboxed. It looks exactly like I thought it would. Very modern and the wood is super smooth. I absolutely love it and would definitely recommend to a friend! If you're hesitating about purchasing this desk... don't.

The professionalism and delivery was outstanding... I will definitely buy from them again. 		https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/583123053/565793081/square.png?1716252224	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/583123053/565793081/square.png?1716252224

Zuri shipped within three days and used FedEx with confirmation code to track. My desk came in several packages, but they were all delivered at the same time. It helped moving the product into the house, otherwise it would have taken multiple people to move one heavy box. Assembly: The desk took roughly 4-5 hours to build myself with no tools required. The instructions provided was straight forward. I didn't run into any complications during the assembly. The mirror can be placed either vertical or horizontal. Careful, it is one heavy piece and you will need help putting it up. Product Quality: Overall, I'm thoroughly impressed with the desk. It's stylish, modern and elegant, which is the vibe I was going for. I was contemplating between this and the smaller Monroe desk that Zuri offers. But in the end, I'm glad I went with the larger model. I recommend checking the measurements in your home office before purchasing. The quality is as good as it looks. The black wooden finish is a solid look. There is ample amount of space on the desk for multiple monitors with additional space for paper work. The desk includes two wiring ports (with two covering options provided) if you do have multiple devices but don't want wires scattered across the desk. Also, the drawers are very spacious for lots of folders or office supplies. One minor complaint: The computer wires will show, and I personally like to hide them. Not much of a problem however, I intend on installing a cable tray under the desk (which there is conveniently enough room between the front cover board and keyboard tray). As for the mirror, I've already received several compliments on it and it is an absolute beautiful addition to the room. 		https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/583120236/565786023/square.png?1716249525	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/583120236/565786098/square.png?1716249535	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/583120236/565786023/square.png?1716249525	https://cdn-yotpo-images-production.yotpo.com/Review/583120236/565786098/square.png?1716249535

The packaging was insane and protected ever inch of it. Despite it coming in so many separate boxes, my husband had it put together in less than two hours. Only downside is it didn't come with keys for the drawers. I have reached out and am waiting to hear back. Hopefully it's universal and they can send replacements.
