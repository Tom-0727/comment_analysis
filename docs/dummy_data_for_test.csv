Not worth it	"If I could give it 0 stars I would.

The comment about the boxes being ""super heavy"" is an objective statement about shipping/packaging, but it is not an aspect covered by the provided angles unless it relates to package integrity or shipping speed, which it does not. The fact that the desk comes in two boxes and the need for a Uhaul/movers is part of the complaint about the return process, not a separate aspect.
