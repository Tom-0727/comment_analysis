Nice office desk overall.	this desk is really nice, however, assembly wise it takes a bit of time to get it properly mounted. I'd suggest they could have made one single panel to facilitate the assembly process and also would give more stability to the desk overall.	5	0	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26YSTQHRQKNN4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CS9KGS3J	2/21/2025							安装难度							{'好评点1': '美观度', '差评点1': '安装时长', '差评点2': '稳定性'}	{'好评点1': '美观度', '差评点1': '安装时长', '差评点2': '稳定性'}	{'好评点1': '美观度', '差评点1': '安装时长', '差评点2': '需拼装组件数量', '差评点3': '稳定性'}

multi piece top, thin metal structure	i didn't realize the desk top was 4 different pieces when i ordered it. i probably wouldn't have selected this on if i had. but with that's said, i really like the desk for the money. it was pretty easy to assemble. for the file cabinet section, they don't give enough detail for orientation of one shelf, so mine is upside down and I'm not taking it apart to fix it at this point, its 2am.  over all its a little flimsy but i guess that's to be expected for the price.	3	1	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSV220ULVAON4/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CS9KGS3J	1/6/2025	性价比	安装难度					安装说明书内容	稳定性						{'好评点1': '性价比', '好评点2': '安装难度', '差评点1': '说明书内容', '差评点2': '稳定性'}	{'好评点1': '性价比', '好评点2': '安装难度', '差评点1': '多板平齐情况', '差评点2': '说明书内容', '差评点3': '稳定性'}	{'差评点1': '桌面材质', '好评点1': '安装难度', '差评点2': '说明书内容', '差评点3': '稳定性'}
Takes time to assemble	"After reading all the reviews about how hard it was to assemble and arriving damaged i was concerned, but thankfully everything arrived with no damage.
Assembly took me about 3 hours but if you have ever put a desk together before its rather straight forward and the instructions are fine.  Some reviews said the instructions were not clear but for me they were.
DO NOT USE A Drill/Screw gun to put this together as its rather cheaper material but still very sturdy once assembled.
Only issue i would say is they could send it with a longer/better screw driver."	4	0	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R36NG0TSZS5G8I/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CS9KGS3J	12/31/2024	包装保护性	安装难度	安装说明书内容	稳定性										{'好评点1': '安装难度', '好评点2': '说明书内容', '好评点3': '稳定性', '差评点1': '螺丝钉外观'}	{'好评点1': '运输货品完好度', '好评点2': '说明书内容', '好评点3': '稳定性', '差评点1': '桌板材质'}	{'好评点1': '运输货品完好度', '差评点1': '安装时长', '好评点2': '安装难度', '好评点3': '说明书内容', '差评点2': '桌板材质', '好评点4': '稳定性', '差评点3': '需拼装组件数量', '差评点4': '五金件损坏情况'}

Honestly love it	"I will say I have decent know how and can be crafty. While the directions are not perfect and sometimes its good to look ahead a few steps to double check how it matches up later. It does in fact all fit together correctly. In my case at least.
For me it's perfect, the height and size of desk make it very spacious and comfortable. It's fairly sturdy so long as your good will your l wrenches. Though at a couple times I found it grueling, getting half rotations and reseting the wrench back to fully tighten it in the corner sockets.
My only issue of it all truly was how the directions made me feel unsure at times which way im suppoped to be looking at the piece im holding. And 2 different sets of pieces were miss numbered(just swapped them around in the build). Though I infact had all the pieces I needed.
Solo build in about 5 hours for both pieces. Arrived separate days so 2 separate build days combined. If you attempt this solo have something with adjustable height for balancing/leveling of bars and boards.

A bit of a pain to assemble but well worth it	"This desk took me about 4-5 hours to assemble by myself. If it was two people assembling I could definitely see that time reduced to about 3 hours.

Quality wise, this is still made out of particle board or something similar, but it is very dense and much more durable than the stuff you get buying the $100-$200 range desks. I was dragging this around, flipping it over, etc and it wasn't being damaged at all.

There's a ton of well utilized space and my computer tucks in really well in the bottom corner. I also love that it's really deep and I can put my monitor really far away.

The only thing I would say needs improvement are the instructions. They can be really unclear at times what orientation something needs to be, and I had to undo stuff and rebuild it flipped the other way about 5 times.

Great size.	"Overall.  Great desk.  I recommend.

Assembling the desk was much easier than the cabinet.  Please make sure you’re patient.  When assembling the desk I’d recommend you not tighten the table top pieces until you’ve placed all 4 tops.  T this will allow you to align the top nice and evenly.  Once all pieces are placed then tighten the screws.

The table top is engineered so don’t over tightened the screws to the top.

Also once your desk is built do not try to lift it with the wood.  Make sure when you move the desk, lift with the metal base or the screw would strip off the wood. “See video”"	4	9	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32MFKWL55Z05/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CS9KGS3J	1/27/2024														{'好评点1': '安装难度', '差评点1': '搬运难度', '差评点2': '螺丝孔位匹配度'}	{'好评点1': '安装难度', '好评点2': '多板平齐情况'}	{'好评点1': '安装难度', '差评点1': '桌板材质'}

Nice design, still worth the price despite small fails	Nice design, perfect for a remote work from home professional like me. All the other desks I looked at seemed like they were built for gamers or kids, so this was a nice find. I’m giving this one a 4 instead of a 5 because there were some quality control issues with some of the panels and the feet for the side cabinet were missing. They gave me a partial refund of $78 for the panels and sent me a set of feet for the cabinet so I’m a happy camper now. You may find that when attaching the top desk panels they may not all be perfectly flat, you can adjust the screws for that or add a few shims as needed. Some of the decorative metal is pretty thin and mine arrived bent up, but it can be bent back if needed. There were issues but not any game changers, and their customer service was exceptional: they responded immediately and took care of the issues stat. Would I buy a desk from this company again? Yes, absolutely.

Very nice	"Searched for a desk to suit my needs for a while now, most are too narrow. This desk is 63"" x 31.5"", and the moveable side return is 39.5"" X 15.75"" - Perfect for my needs.

You can move the return anywhere you want it, even if you put the 2 pieces across the room it looks nice.

Assembly wasn't hard, but the bottom of the Cabinet/Return has holes marked where the screws for the feet should go, but the holes don't line up with the holes in the feet, I was able to overcome this issue with a slow cordless drill and there are supposed to be some plastic corner pieces that go in the back, but my particular box was missing those. Not enough to remove a star.

Shipping was pretty quick, 2 boxes, 1 yesterday and 1 today, both still arrived before the delivery window I was given at purchase.

However, it was pretty difficult to put together at times as the pieces mentioned in the instruction manual did not always match the pieces you actually needed to use. We figured it out, but it took a bit longer to put together. Also was missing a few pieces, but they were non-essential but would have been nice to have.	4	6	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAMYKC6KBLSFT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CS9KGS3J	1/12/2024							安装难度	安装说明书	安装时长	缺件情况				{'好评点1': '整体收纳空间', '差评点1': '安装难度', '差评点2': '说明书内容', '差评点3': '安装时长', '差评点4': '缺件情况'}	{'好评点1': '美观度', '差评点1': '安装难度', '差评点2': '说明书内容', '差评点3': '缺件情况'}	{'好评点1': '美观度', '差评点1': '安装难度', '差评点2': '说明书内容', '差评点3': '安装时长', '差评点4': '缺件情况'}
Looks great & easy to construct	The desk looks amazing! The width is great for organizing my work and using my laptop at the same time. I love how the two pieces allow for an L-shaped set up or as separate pieces in my office. 3 of the pre-machined holes were not correctly aligned, but I was able to use my tools at home to fix them to complete construction. As another purchaser mentioned, one of the pieces arrived bent in the exact same place so that appears to be a production issue. I was able to use a tool to bend it back in place easily. Still, a great item and I’m glad I chose it!	5	4	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BIUGVBIBDPBX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CS9KGS3J	12/29/2023	美观度						螺丝&孔位匹配度	桌体破损情况						{'好评点1': '美观度', '好评点2': '整体收纳空间', '好评点3': '稳定性', '差评点1': '螺丝孔位匹配度', '差评点2': '五金件损坏情况'}	{'好评点1': '美观度', '好评点2': '整体收纳空间', '好评点3': '多板平齐情况', '差评点1': '螺丝孔位匹配度', '差评点2': '金属零部件变形情况'}	{'好评点1': '美观度', '好评点2': '整体收纳空间', '差评点1': '螺丝孔位匹配度', '差评点2': '金属零部件变形情况'}

Solid piece	"I have been using the desk for about 3 weeks.  It seems to be well made.  The drawers work smooth and sides and top are solid.  The black counter is a little tricky to keep looking nice.  Shows finger prints and smudges but not a big concern for me.  The only downside so far has been trying to find a keyboard tray that works.  The metal bar under the top, that keeps the two pieces secure, prohibits the installation of a tray.  Will continue to look for options.
I would recommend."	4	0	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3O09U1M7XQ61B/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7M9BKQY	2/18/2025	抽屉滑轨顺畅度	桌板材质					易清洁性质							{'好评点1': '整体收纳空间', '好评点2': '抽屉滑轨顺畅度', '差评点1': '桌面材质'}	"根据评论提取的好评点和差评点如下：

A solid purchase, but a few flaws	"I just purchased and assembled this desk to replace a worn-out desk of similar quality. Here's some notes for those who are considering the same:

* Shipping was fast. The desk shipped within 24 hours from CA. Since I'm in AZ it arrived only a few days later. The desk was packed in 2 boxes, which arrived one day apart. Not surprisingly the boxes are big and heavy, about 65lb and 85lb each. You'll definitely need a dolly or a couple strong people to help move them from your doorstep. The boxes themselves were damaged in transit, but the liberal use of styrofoam (yuck) prevented any damage inside.
* The instructions consisted of diagrams with minimal words. However the steps were mostly understandable and words were used to point out especially critical steps when the diagram wasn't clear enough.  Some steps were still vague however, requiring extra scrutiny or trial-and-error. All parts were clearly labeled and several spares of each screw and nut were generously included.
* The 45-steps took several hours to complete as not a single piece was pre-assembled. Having a helper insert dowels, screws or assemble drawers while you work on the major steps will save a lot of time. Also an electric screwdriver with a phillips and hex head will save a LOT of effort! Thankfully no other tools are required.
* Be sure to assemble the desk in the same room where it will be placed. The 2 sides are not designed to separate, and once assembled it is semi-permanent. Also be aware the cabinet on the left and the drawers on the right are NOT reversible, the pre-drilled holes do not allow for any option besides what is shown.
* For some inexplicable reason, several locknuts and screws are located on the outside of the desk so they are clearly visible. They could have easily been placed on the other side which would have hidden them under the desktop, but the manufacturer must assume this desk will be placed in a corner with both outer sides against the wall. At least small matching stickers are included to hide the some (but not all) of the holes, but it still looks unattractive if any outer side is visible to the room.
* For pre-fab, engineered wood furniture this desk is pretty sturdy. The wood plates are thick and heavy, and the joined pieces are highly reinforced. For example there over 28 locknuts and screws securing the desktop to the body.  The drawers are solid and slide easily and appear they could hold a lot of weight.
* The cabinet does not have any holes or perforations on the back panel. If you plan on placing a PC or other electric equipment inside, you'll have to cut a wiring hole yourself.
* The black surface of the desk looks nice, especially compared to the faux-woodgrain design of other cheap furniture, but it seems every speck of dust and fingerprint is obvious. It's likely the surface will never look pristine!

Overall I'm happy with my purchase. There are some flaws and room for improvement, but I feel like I got my money worth. This isn't something you'll pass on to your grandkids, but its certainly good enough to write this review on!"	4	4	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RR4XJEH328EYT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7M9BKQY	1/23/2025	物流速度	包装保护性	安装说明书内容	使用噪音	抽屉承重能力	美观度	搬运难度	安装时长	安装难度	柜门开合顺畅度	桌面防水性	线缆管理	耐脏性	{'好评点1': '物流速度', '好评点2': '说明书内容', '好评点3': '稳定性', '好评点4': '抽屉滑轨顺畅度', '好评点5': '桌板材质', '好评点6': '美观度', '差评点1': '搬运难度', '差评点2': '安装时长', '差评点3': '解说不清晰', '差评点4': '桌面防水性'}	{'好评点1': '物流速度', '差评点1': '搬运难度', '差评点2': '包装保护性', '差评点3': '说明书内容', '差评点4': '需拼装组件数量', '差评点5': '螺丝钉外观', '差评点6': '线缆管理', '好评点2': '桌板材质', '好评点3': '稳定性', '好评点4': '抽屉滑轨顺畅度', '差评点7': '易清洁性质'}	"{

Great Purchase! Solid Desk.	"I absolutely love my new desk. There is room for everything. I upgraded to a corner desk because my new project requires that I use their company laptop, and I still needed to use my company’s laptop. With this desk the layout is perfect.
It took my husband several hours to assemble. He did it a little bit at a time after work for a few nights, so I can’t give an exact time, but it was from 4-6 hours. He’s very good with building and woodworking. He did tell me that someone less skilled at such things would be able to assemble it. The directions were clear.
I have two negatives.
1. One of the corners had about a quarter size chip. I am not bothered by it, but some others may be.
2. The edges are rough. If the edges were beveled, it would be so much better. I’ll need to find a solution as it is irritating to my forearms as I type. I’m sure that I’ll find a solution. They are beveled on the bottom, so it is possible that the manufactured put the drill and bit holes on the wrong side of the boards.
This is a sturdy desk that should last me for many years. It is a huge win for me!"	4	5	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29SZUDW7213P8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7M9BKQY	12/26/2024	美观度	安装说明书	稳定性				安装时长	桌体破损情况	桌板表面完整性					{'好评点1': '整体收纳空间', '好评点2': '安装难度', '好评点3': '说明书内容', '差评点1': '桌体破损情况', '差评点2': '桌面边缘处理', '差评点3': '稳定性'}	{'好评点1': '整体收纳空间', '好评点2': '说明书内容', '好评点3': '稳定性', '差评点1': '安装时长', '差评点2': '桌体破损情况', '差评点3': '桌面边缘处理'}	{'好评点1': '整体收纳空间', '好评点2': '安装难度', '好评点3': '说明书内容', '差评点1': '桌体破损情况', '差评点2': '桌面边缘处理', '好评点4': '稳定性'}

Nice desk for the money	It's going to take a few hours to assemble so set aside a half day to do this.  It's like putting a 500 piece puzzle together, lol.  It was not difficult, but took longer than expected. You really have to pay attention to the pictures and look ahead a few steps to understand at times, but it came out better than expected.  The top of the desk is very easily damaged so be careful when dealing with those 2 parts especially.  Great desk for the money.  Fit very well in a small corner space in my bonus room.	5	9	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFMFBWQ377X2C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7M9BKQY	10/21/2024	安装难度						安装时长	组件数量	安装说明书	桌板完整性				{'好评点1': '安装难度', '差评点1': '安装时长', '差评点2': '桌体破损情况', '好评点2': '整体收纳空间'}	{'差评点1': '安装时长', '好评点1': '安装难度', '差评点2': '桌体破损情况', '好评点2': '整体收纳空间'}	{'差评点1': '安装时长', '好评点1': '安装难度', '差评点2': '说明书内容', '好评点2': '美观度', '差评点3': '桌板材质', '好评点3': '整体收纳空间'}
Very sturdy product. All wood.	Using for sewing desk. The only thing i didn't like is the finish is just a thin coating that was peeled up in a couple spots.	4	2	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3B8HG697GMCM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7M9BKQY	9/27/2024							桌板表面完整性							{'差评点1': '桌面材质'}	{'差评点1': '桌面材质'}	{'差评点1': '桌面材质'}
Looks cheap because it is cheap	The deal comes in two huge boxes and were destroyed when they arrived.  The product was found to be cracked and busted in places but the headache to deal with the supplier and Amazon was just not worth the trouble.  We put it together (husband is a contractor and still took over 6 hours as it’s in 400 tiny parts.  After all built it has nothing over the screw holes and such.  IT NEEDS a lot better overall look but it’s an Amazon desk….

Good guality	The assembly book is all pictures. No words to read. The pictures of end cabinets changes in the middle of the booklet. The desk top can only go one way, so look at last picture when you get to middle of booklet.

Great Desk	I bought this for my home office.  The unit is quite solid, attractive and functional.  The only issue I would impart is that you need to set aside some time to assemble this unit.  The instructions were good, but lengthy and time is needed to do the job and do it right.  But that's pretty much inevitable with a product such as this isn't it?  That said, the desk was well packaged and arrived in good condition.  ALL of the drilled holes for the hardware lined-up perfectly.  So much so, that I was rather impressed by the accuracy of the manufacturing.	5	8	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12G9AH0LFXM5J/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7M9BKQY	7/27/2024	稳定性	安装说明书内容	包装保护性	螺丝&孔位匹配度			安装时长							{'好评点1': '整体收纳空间', '好评点2': '美观度', '好评点3': '安装难度', '好评点4': '说明书内容', '好评点5': '包装保护性', '好评点6': '螺丝孔位匹配度'}	{'好评点1': '美观度', '好评点2': '整体收纳空间', '差评点1': '安装时长', '好评点3': '包装保护性', '好评点4': '运输货品完好度', '好评点5': '螺丝孔位匹配度'}	{'好评点1': '稳定性', '好评点2': '美观度', '好评点3': '整体收纳空间', '差评点1': '安装时长', '好评点4': '说明书内容', '好评点5': '包装保护性', '好评点6': '运输货品完好度', '好评点7': '螺丝孔位匹配度'}
Nice looking office desk	"We purchased the black and white desk. It turned out great, it was a nice upgrade for us.
Things to know:
It is shipped in 2 packages. Our 2nd package was delayed, but customer service was helpful with a tracking number.
The top surface shows every fingerprint, a little annoying, but not terrible. The desk top is like a wood laminate but the rest is good wood.
The drawers are not near as deep as the desk: a little over 13"" compared to 22"" on the desk top.
It is a big project to put together, it took 3 nights for us to complete it."	4	6	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PH5U0YDU1K9S/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0D7M9BKQY	7/27/2024	客服质量	桌板材质	耐脏性				物流速度	桌面材质	抽屉尺寸	安装时长				{'好评点1': '美观度', '好评点2': '客服质量', '差评点1': '物流速度', '差评点2': '抽屉大小', '差评点3': '安装时长', '差评点4': '需拼装组件数量'}	"{
