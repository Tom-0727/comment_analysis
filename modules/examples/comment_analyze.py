Example3: comment="The desk is beautiful looking although it is a little bit deceiving. Kinda wish I ordered a different one. I agree with other reviews that the set up takes forever and there are SO MANY PARTS! I am petite/5'3 and bought a computer chair that is equivalent to the height of a dining room table chair, nothing special and I have a hard time putting my legs under so I do wish it was taller. Also, the drawers aren't as deep as the desk is so that's a bummer they are so small. It's just big enough to fit a 8 x 10 sheet of paper. Overall looks beautiful but functionality can be improved."; output={'Pos1': 'Aesthetics', 'Neg1': 'Installation Time', 'Neg2': 'Number of Assembly Parts', 'Neg3': 'Legroom Space', 'Neg4': 'Storage Space'}''',
