    "\n",
    "* Shipping was fast. The desk shipped within 24 hours from CA. Since I'm in AZ it arrived only a few days later. The desk was packed in 2 boxes, which arrived one day apart. Not surprisingly the boxes are big and heavy, about 65lb and 85lb each. You'll definitely need a dolly or a couple strong people to help move them from your doorstep. The boxes themselves were damaged in transit, but the liberal use of styrofoam (yuck) prevented any damage inside.\n",
    "* The instructions consisted of diagrams with minimal words. However the steps were mostly understandable and words were used to point out especially critical steps when the diagram wasn't clear enough.  Some steps were still vague however, requiring extra scrutiny or trial-and-error. All parts were clearly labeled and several spares of each screw and nut were generously included.\n",
    "* The 45-steps took several hours to complete as not a single piece was pre-assembled. Having a helper insert dowels, screws or assemble drawers while you work on the major steps will save a lot of time. Also an electric screwdriver with a phillips and hex head will save a LOT of effort! Thankfully no other tools are required.\n",
    "* Be sure to assemble the desk in the same room where it will be placed. The 2 sides are not designed to separate, and once assembled it is semi-permanent. Also be aware the cabinet on the left and the drawers on the right are NOT reversible, the pre-drilled holes do not allow for any option besides what is shown.\n",
    "* For some inexplicable reason, several locknuts and screws are located on the outside of the desk so they are clearly visible. They could have easily been placed on the other side which would have hidden them under the desktop, but the manufacturer must assume this desk will be placed in a corner with both outer sides against the wall. At least small matching stickers are included to hide the some (but not all) of the holes, but it still looks unattractive if any outer side is visible to the room.\n",
    "* For pre-fab, engineered wood furniture this desk is pretty sturdy. The wood plates are thick and heavy, and the joined pieces are highly reinforced. For example there over 28 locknuts and screws securing the desktop to the body.  The drawers are solid and slide easily and appear they could hold a lot of weight.\n",
    "* The cabinet does not have any holes or perforations on the back panel. If you plan on placing a PC or other electric equipment inside, you'll have to cut a wiring hole yourself.\n",
    "* The black surface of the desk looks nice, especially compared to the faux-woodgrain design of other cheap furniture, but it seems every speck of dust and fingerprint is obvious. It's likely the surface will never look pristine!\n",
    "\n",

    "It took my husband several hours to assemble. He did it a little bit at a time after work for a few nights, so I can’t give an exact time, but it was from 4-6 hours. He’s very good with building and woodworking. He did tell me that someone less skilled at such things would be able to assemble it. The directions were clear.\n",
    "I have two negatives.\n",
    "1. One of the corners had about a quarter size chip. I am not bothered by it, but some others may be.\n",
    "2. The edges are rough. If the edges were beveled, it would be so much better. I’ll need to find a solution as it is irritating to my forearms as I type. I’m sure that I’ll find a solution. They are beveled on the bottom, so it is possible that the manufactured put the drill and bit holes on the wrong side of the boards.\n",

It took me almost 30 minutes to figure out how to disassemble the tracks for the drawers to get them on their respective parts.  Personally, these should ship on the drawers/walls already to make it easier.  The steps in the booklet are completely out of order. Do yourself a favor and skip ahead and assemble each drawer, etc individually to make sure you're properly aligned before you get ahead and realize you flubbed step 2 and need to go back.  Don't do the way they do it.  But also be mindful you may need to adjust the tracks again. My top drawer was crooked so I had to remove it, adjust the track down and fit it in.  It can be tricky to get all the parts to align.  That said, this mom did the whole thing alone. The cabinet took longer than the desk, for sure. My one drawer is slightly off but it closes and you can't tell unless you're looking for it.  Its pretty good quality for the money.  Very sleek design. Shipping was great-does come in 2 boxes that may not arrive together!\n",
    "\n",
    "Would recommend but just be prepared to put in some elbow grease. And the tracks pull apart - if that saves anyone time and mental head slapping 🤣🤣\"''',\n",
    "'''I purchased this desk for my home office. It is the perfect height, looks great in the space, adequate storage for my needs, and very comfortable when I am working at my desk.''',\n",
    "'''I love everything about this desk and for this price I’m impressed!!! I actually have nothing negative to say about it. Great job! ❤️ it!!''',\n",
    "'''\"Looked nice after I finished. 586 total pieces. Was delivered with one of the drawers bottoms broke.\n",
    "Looked like a fork truck fork was run into the end of box.  There must be 250 plus holes you need to pilot drill. Don't go to deep you will leave a mark on other side. Test your drill size in some scrap wood. This is not wood. Some kind of processed material. like very dence gray cardboard / drywall. You can't use power driver to install screws, Strips them out. Must do buy hand. I'm pretty handy with mechanical stuff.  Had over 25 hours in unpacking assembly and cleanup. Thats without replace / fix the drawer bottom.\n",
    " Good Luck\"''',\n",
    "'''I fell in love with my desk but unfortunately it came damaged. I can’t request a refund according to the description and have to wait a few days for an answer. I wish it was not the front portion itself but it’s visible.''',\n",
    "'''I love the size of the desk. The problem with the desk is that pieces were missing from the desk. After I assembled the desk by myself, the side with the 3 drawers was clearly the weaker side, and ended up messing up the back piece once I moved it into my room. The drawers seem to get loose from time to time and I know I put them in correctly. I am a person that puts together furniture on the regular and the instructions were a little convoluted in my opinion. I know once I move out of my mom's house, I'll probably throw it away because it won't survive. I'll be on the lookout for a new desk just as large that will be more secure. I would give it a 55%.''',\n",
    "'''I just received this desk. The box was badly damaged and most of the pieces inside are chipped and even some the wood has split. Don't buy this desk.''',\n",
    "'''\"We were initially unsure on the color based on stock photos but the desk is definitely black. We replaced out the black hardware with gold hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "Did take +4hrs to put together but very pleased with the desk!\n",
    "\n",
    "Highly Recommend!\"''',\n",
    "'''\"Great experience and great desk. The desk arrives in two very large rectangle boxes. Very heavy, you will need help bringing it inside. Packed very well, no damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assembly was obviously a bit lengthy given the size of this desk, but there is a YouTube video and paper instructions so it was easy and straightforward. I never got to a point in the instructions where I was confused. You might need the help of a second person on some parts, but I managed to do it all by myself. All the holes align very well. I had no issues along the build.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have my desk against a wall, and I absolutely love it. There is so much space on this desk, you have room for a computer + so much more. For reference in my pictures, my monitor is 27 inches wide and it fits with so much extra space. Its great.\n",
    "\n",
    "The desk is strong and sturdy, and is of pretty good quality. If I had to buy a desk over again, it would be this. I 100% made the right choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In one of my pictures, you can also see one of their shelves next to the desk as well.\"''',\n",
    "'''Looks nice, easy to assemble. It's a little clunky, but overall for what it costs you're not going to find a better desk.''',\n",
    "'''Sturdy and looks great, definitely recommend''',\n",
    "'''Just want to write this review as this is an appreciation for customer service from Tribesigns. Product arrived on time and I was assembling it myself. While screwing it lower portion one wooden piece damaged. As in the user manual itself they mentioned to contact the customer care before raising a return request. I contacted thru email and I received reply same day asking for photos and additional details. When I provided they apologized and gave option to replace the full piece. I was looking for replacement part as I already assembled remaining things. As spare parts not available they offered me 50% refund which I accepted and immediately send it Amazon account. Appreciate the customer service and I would love to buy my next product confidently from amazon.''',\n",
    "'''We love this desk-it is very spacious and we like the black top! Assembly does take a while though.''',\n",
    "'''This desk is absolutely beautiful! It’s study and with nice size drawers and cabinets. The metal handles are nice touch. The instructions were very simple. If you looking for an elegant desk for your office this is a must have!''',\n",
    "'''We are missing 4 screws and cannot put the desk together.''',\n",
    "'''\"I purchased the 70in desk and I probably should have payed attention to the measurements because it is very wide lol.\n",
    "I was able to build the desk on my own. It's pretty heavy but it's very sturdy!\"'''\n",
