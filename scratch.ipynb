They measure just 11-1/2” in length and 10” wide. The file drawer (lower right) is mainly where this is a problem for us. A typical file folder system has to be compacted to fit and forget about a hanging file set up. Not sure why they made the drawers so shallow — if they were the depth of the desk itself, it would have much better functionality. The cabinet (lower left) is the full depth of the desk itself — — 20”. Read the drawer sizes carefully — depending on your needs, it may or may not work for you. Otherwise the desk is very solid.\n",
